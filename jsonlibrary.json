        "description": "Romola is a 1924 American silent drama film directed by Henry King and shot on location in Italy. The film stars Lillian Gish, Dorothy Gish, William Powell, and Ronald Colman, and is based on the 1863 George Eliot novel of the same name.\nThis was the second film in which Henry King directed Lillian Gish and Ronald Colman for Inspiration Films, an independent production company which chiefly consisted of King, Charles Duell, and stars Lillian Gish and Richard Barthelmess.\nPlot\nAs described in a review in a film magazine, a boat approaching Italy is set upon by pirates and Baldassaro, a noted scholar, gives his adopted son Tito a ring that will be a passport with all men of learning. Tito escapes but Baldassaro is captured. Tito reaches Florence at the time that the people incited by the priest, Savonarola, has risen and cast out their ruler, Piero de Medici. Accidentally he aids Bardi, a blind man and noted scholar and is received with honors, finally winning consent to his marriage to his daughter Romola who loves Carlo, an artist. Through the aid of Spini, an adventurer who has become the real power behind the government, Tito rises to the post of chief magistrate. In the meantime he flirts with Tessa, a peasant girl, going through a mock marriage during a carnival, which is very real to Tessa, so he installs her in a house. A child is born to them. Tito shows his real nature when he sells the priceless books of Bardi, and Romola leaves him. He issues a decree that means death to Savonarola, but his ambition overleaps itself and he is chased by the mob. Jumping into the river, he meets death by drowning at the hands of Baldassaro, whom he has refused to recognize. Romola meets Tessa and befriends her, and finally finds happiness with Carlo who has remained faithful to her.\nCast\nLillian Gish as Romola\nDorothy Gish as Tessa\nWilliam Powell as Tito Melema (credited as William H. Powell)\nRonald Colman as Carlo Bucellini\nCharles Willis Lane as Baldassar Calvo\nHerbert Grimwood as Girolamo Savonarola\nBonaventura Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez as Bardo Bardi\nFrank Puglia as Adolfo Spini\nAmelia Summerville as Brigida\nTina Ceccaci Renaldi as Monna Ghita\nEduilio Mucci as Nello\nAngela Scatigna as Bratti\nUgo Uccellini as Bishop of Nemours\nAlfredo Martinelli as Captain of the Barque\nAttilo Deodati as Tomaso\nProduction\nRomola was part of a 1920s boomlet for American silent films shot on locations outside the United States. Such films were intended to attract American viewers through exotic novelty, enhance the artistic prestige of directors, and make American films more appealing to foreign audiences. Examples of such films include The Christian (London: 1923), The Bright Shawl (Cuba: 1923) and The Four Feathers (Tanzania and Sudan: 1929). Foreign locations did not become part of American filmmaking again until the 1950s.\nWilliam Powell later described the production of Romola as a 29-week comedy of errors starting with the capsizing of the boat for the pirate sequence at the onset of filming.\nBecause no one in the company spoke Italian, the quest to obtain tights for Powell and Colman culminated in a two-week detour to Milan to a theatrical tailor for La Scala Opera House. When Powell and Colman returned to the sea-side town of Livorno, they found the film company had departed without leaving a forwarding address. Powell and Colman cabled company offices in London and New York but ran out of money for food while awaiting a response. Powell described it as the hungriest time of his life, when he envied town animals who had owners to feed them.\nThankfully, the shoot later became an idyll, with plenty of time to savor the pleasures of Rome and learn Italian, thanks to a relaxed production schedule.",

It is an adaption of the 1918 novel The Magnificent Ambersons by Booth Tarkington.\nAs described in a review in a film magazine, twenty-five or thirty years ago, every small town boasted of its Amberson family, whose home was the show place and whose every move made news. Major Amberson's (King) daughter Isabel (Calhoun) loves Eugene Morgan (Forrest), but he gets himself in disgrace by performing a drunken serenade, and leaves town. Isabel marries Wilbur Minafer (MacDonald), a poor second choice, who makes a very passable husband. Not loving her husband, Isabel centers all of the love in her heart upon her son George, who naturally grows from a very spoiled young boy into a despicable young cad. His extravagances eventually deplete the Amberson fortune. When his father dies, George resents his mother's love for Morgan, who has returned as a prosperous automobile manufacturer. George has come to love, however, Morgan's daughter Lucy (Merriam). The death of Major Amberson forces George to go to work, bringing about his regeneration. Then there is the heroic rescue of Isabel by Morgan when the home in which she lodges burns. The final tableau suggests the rehabilitation of George.\nCast\nCullen Landis as George Minafer\nBen Alexander as George Minafer, as a child\nAllan Forrest as Eugene Morgan\nAlice Calhoun as Isabel Minafer\nEmmett King as Major Amberson\nWallace MacDonald as Wilbur Minafer\nCharlotte Merriam as Lucy Morgan\nKathryn Adams as Fanny Minafer\nAggie Herring as Mrs. Foster\nWilliam Irving as George Amberson",

        "description": "Peter Pan is a 1924 American silent adventure film released by Paramount Pictures, the first film adaptation of the 1904 play by J. M. Barrie. It was directed by Herbert Brenon and starred Betty Bronson as Peter Pan, Ernest Torrence as Captain Hook, Mary Brian as Wendy, Virginia Browne Faire as Tinker Bell, Esther Ralston as Mrs. Darling, and Anna May Wong as the American Indian princess Tiger Lily.\nPlot\nAs described in a review in a film magazine, Mrs. Darling (Ralston) is worried because she has seen a boyish face at the nursery window and found a shadow on the floor, but reluctantly goes to a party with her husband (Chadwick). Because Mr. Darling is so strict, the family cannot keep a nurse, so the three children are left in the charge of the dog Nana (Ali). Soon the lively boy Peter Pan (Bronson) appears at the window with the fairy Tinker Bell (Faire), and he finds his shadow in a desk drawer. Wendy (Brian), the oldest child, awakens and sees Peter, and he tells her of his home in the woods and about the fairies. Peter teaches the children to fly and they go away to Never Never Land to join the colony of Lost Boys, who have fallen out of carriages when their nurses were not looking. Tinker Bell is jealous and prompts one of the Lost Boys to shoot Wendy, thinking she is a bird, and she almost dies. The boys, who live in an underground home, adopt Wendy as their mother. A band of American Indians is friendly and battle a band of pirates led by Captain Hook (Torrence), but are defeated. The Captain hates Peter because he blames him for a crocodile that once bit off his hand. Because the crocodile follows him, the Captain fears him and fed it an alarm clock so that its tick-tock will warn him of its approach. The pirates carry off the children and leave poison in Peter's medicine. Tinker Bell drinks the poison and almost dies, but is saved when the children in the audience say that they believe in fairies. Peter enlists the aid of mermaids to get aboard the pirate ship and, with the help of the Proud Boys, they fight and conquer the pirates. Wendy and the children then fly back home. Mrs. Darling, who has grieved, thinks she is dreaming when she sees her children until the rush up on her. Wendy wants to keep Peter, but he says he never wants to grow up. Mrs. Darling agrees to allow Wendy to go back once a year to help Peter with his spring cleaning, and he leaves to go back to the home in the woods. Mr. and Mrs. Darling adopt all of the Lost Boys.\nCast\nBetty Bronson as Peter Pan\nErnest Torrence as Captain Hook\nMary Brian as Wendy Darling\nJack Murphy as John Darling\nPhilippe De Lacy as Michael Darling\nVirginia Brown Faire as Tinker Bell\nGeorge Ali as Nana the dog and Crocodile\nEsther Ralston as Mrs. Darling\nCyril Chadwick as Mr. Darling\nAnna May Wong as Tiger Lily\nMaurice Murphy as Tootles\nMickey McBan as Slightly\nGeorge Crane Jr. as Curly\nWinston Doty as 1st Twin\nWeston Doty as 2nd Twin\nTerence McMillan as Nibs\nLouis Morrison as Gentleman Starkey\nEdward Kipling as Smee\nRobert Milasch as Kelt",

        "description": "The Big Parade is a 1925 American silent war drama film directed by King Vidor, starring John Gilbert, Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e, Hobart Bosworth, Tom O'Brien, and Karl Dane. Written by World War I veteran, Laurence Stallings, the film is about an idle rich boy who joins the US Army's Rainbow Division and is sent to France to fight in World War I, becomes a friend of two working class men, experiences the horrors of trench warfare, and finds love with a French girl.\nThe film has been praised for its realistic depiction of warfare, and it heavily influenced a great many subsequent war films, especially All Quiet on the Western Front (1930). The Big Parade is regarded as one of the greatest films made about World War I, and in 1992 it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.\nPlot\nIn the United States in 1917, James \"Jim\" Apperson's (John Gilbert) idleness (in contrast to his hardworking brother) incurs the great displeasure of his wealthy businessman father. Then America enters World War I. Jim informs his worried mother that he has no intention of enlisting, and his father threatens to kick him out of the house if he does not join. However, when he runs into his patriotic friends at a send-off parade, he is persuaded to enlist, making his father very proud.\nDuring training, Jim makes friendships with Southern construction worker Slim (Karl Dane) and Bronx bartender Bull (Tom O'Brien). Their unit ships out to France, where they are billeted at a farm in the village of Champillon in the Marne.\nAll three men are attracted to Melisande (Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e), whose mother owns the farm. She repulses all their advances, but gradually warms to Jim, bonding at first over chewing gum. They eventually fall in love, despite not being able to speak each other's language. One day, however, Jim receives a letter and a photograph from Justyn (Claire Adams), which reveals that they are engaged. When Melisande sees the picture, she realizes the situation and runs off in tears. Before Jim can decide what to do, his unit is ordered to the front. Melisande hears the commotion and races back, just in time for the lovers to embrace and kiss.\nThe Americans march towards the front and are strafed by an enemy fighter before it is shot down. The unit is sent to the attack immediately, advancing against snipers and machine guns in the woods, then more machine guns, artillery, and poison gas in the open. They settle down in a makeshift line. Jim shelters in a shellhole with Slim and Bull.\nThat night, orders come down for one man to go out and eliminate a troublesome mortar crew; Slim wins a spitting contest for the opportunity. He succeeds, but is spotted and wounded on the way back. After listening to Slim's pleas for help, Jim cannot stand it any longer and goes to his rescue against orders. Bull follows, but is shot and killed. By the time Jim reaches Slim, he is already dead. Jim is then shot in the leg. When a German (George Beranger) comes to finish him off, Jim shoots and wounds him. The German starts crawling back to his line. Jim catches up to him in another shellhole, but, face to face, cannot bring himself to finish him off with his bayonet. Instead, he gives his erstwhile enemy a cigarette. Soon after, the German dies. However, Jim is not stuck in no man's land for long; the Americans attack, and he is taken away to a hospital.\nFrom another patient, he learns that Champillon has changed hands four times. Worried about Melisande, Jim sneaks out of the hospital and hitches a ride. When he gets to the farmhouse, he finds it damaged and empty. Melisande and her mother have joined a stream of refugees. Jim collapses and is carried off in an ambulance by retreating soldiers.\nAfter the war ends, Jim goes home to America. Before he arrives, his mother overhears Justyn and Jim's brother Harry (Robert Ober) discussing what to do; in Jim's absence, they have fallen in love. When Jim appears, it is revealed that he has had his leg amputated. Later, Jim tells his mother about Melisande; she tells him to go back and find her. When he returns to the farm, Melisande rushes into his arms.\nCast\nJohn Gilbert as James Apperson\nRen\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e as Melisande\nHobart Bosworth as Mr. Apperson\nClaire McDowell as Mrs. Apperson\nClaire Adams as Justyn Reed\nRobert Ober as Harry Apperson\nTom O'Brien as Bull\nKarl Dane as Slim\nRosita Marstini as Melisande's mother\nHarry Crocker as Soldier (uncredited)\nJulanne Johnston as Justine Devereux\nKathleen Key as Apperson sister\nCarl Voss as Officer (uncredited)\nGeorge Beranger as German soldier\nFrank Currier\nDan Mason",

You can find it as a direct-download here, but please if possible use the torrent and help seed! DVD features: High-quality video encoding; Director's Commentary featuring Nina Paley and Karl Fogel; Subtitles including English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Chinese, Dutch and Finnish; Customized chapter selection screens with screenshot previews - chapters are biased towards the Annette Hanshaw songs (for lack of anything better to base them on); Two trailers; Full-resolution anamorphic 16x9 video with 16x9 menus; A few fun easter-eggs. Please download, help seed, spread the word, and let me know what you think! 1080p/FLAC version: This is a remuxing of the 1080p .mp4 version of the movie as originally posted, combining the exact same video with the original uncompressed audio track in FLAC. That means that as of now, this is the highest possible quality version available. NOTICE: Please use the torrent if you can - it is webseeded by the uploaded version here yet will probably give you better download speeds. 720p AVCHD .iso: Please use the torrent... This is burnable to one blank DVD, and should play on many blu-ray players including the Playstation 3. (check your player's documentation for the \"AVCHD\" logo; if it doesn't have it, bug the manufacturer to implement it in a firmware upgrade!) This .iso contains the original 720p video (non-transcoded) as well as original PCM audio. AVCHD is basically like a blu-ray quality disc but smaller, small enough to fit on a single-layer DVD blank. I've found that the disc is unrecognized in my computer's DVD drive after burning, but it plays in my Panasonic BD35k blu-ray player just beautifully, in full 720p HD.",

        "date": "1897",
        "subject": "boxing",
        "description": "The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight is an 1897 documentary film directed by Enoch J. Rector depicting the 1897 boxing match between James J. Corbett and Bob Fitzsimmons in Carson City, Nevada on St. Patrick's Day. Originally running for more than 100 minutes, it was the longest film released to date; as such, it was the world's first feature film. \nThe technology that allowed this is known as the Latham loop. Rector claimed to have invented the device, but its invention is disputed. He used three such equipped cameras placed adjacently and filming on 63mm nitrate film. Only fragments of the film survive. The known fragments were transferred in the 1980s from a print owned by Jean A. LeRoy of New York City, the transfer done on a specially built optical printer to convert the film to 35mm film. The film was also the first to be shot in widescreen, with an aspect ratio of about 1.65:1. According to Dan Streible, The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight is \"one of the earliest individual productions to sustain public commentary on the cinema.\" The film is so important to film history that Luke McKernan declared, \"it was boxing that created the cinema.\" As noted by Seth Abraham, the president of Time Warner Sports, it was the first motion picture to ever depict the championship prizefight. Its nationwide screenings can be regarded as the first pay-per-view media event in boxing history, for the fight produced more income in box office than in live gate receipts, it was immensely profitable and the picture served as a long-standing model for future amusement entrepreneurs. Prizefighting was illegal in 21 states and many cities and states tried to ban the film, but their efforts to ban fight films was mostly unsuccessful.\nIn 2012, the film was added to the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress as a \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant film\".\nSynopsis\nThe film no longer exists in its entirety; however, it is known from contemporary sources that the film included all fourteen rounds of the event, each round lasting three minutes. This was not unusual for a boxing film, although each round would previously have been presented as a separate attraction. What made this film exceptional is a five-minute introduction that showed former champion John L. Sullivan (whom Corbett defeated in 1892) and his manager, Billy Madden, introducing the event, the introduction of referee George Siler, and both boxers entering the ring in their robes.\nThe one-minute rests between each round were captured on film and when it was reissued it included a ten-minute epilogue of the empty ring at the end of the fight, into which members of the audience eventually stormed. Even with these approximate timings, the film ran a minimum of 71 minutes, and sources generally report that it exceeded 90 or 100 minutes. The film climaxes with Fitzsimmons hitting Corbett in the solar plexus for a knockout and Corbett crawling outside the space of the camera so that he is not visible above the waist.\nProduction\nEnoch J. Rector had been an employee of the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company, which filmed Corbett and Courtney Before the Kinetograph (1894) in six one minute rounds, each exhibited via the Edison Kinetoscope as a separate peep show for a separate fee. Some time after leaving the company, Rector arranged for the film with boxing promoter Dan Stuart. Stuart offered $10,000 to the winner of the bout in an agreement signed by both boxers on 4 January 1897. Corbett, along with his fans, was eager to win back the title that he had lost to Fitzsimmons in Mexico. Producer William Aloysius Brady got an agreement from Rector that 25% of the proceeds of the film would go to him and Corbett; Fitzsimmons and his manager, Martin Julian, would receive $13,000. Fitzsimmons was outraged upon learning of the deal, and the terms were renegotiated. Under the new terms, each boxer and his manager would take 25%, with Rector, Stuart, and Samuel J. Tilden Jr (who had left Kinetoscope with Rector in a battle over who invented the Latham loop) dividing the remaining 50%.\nBirt Acres, a British cinematographist of Barnet, England, who shot footage of the 1896 Henley Royal Regatta on 70mm film using a ratio wider than 1.33 x 1, sought an opportunity and sent a cameraman to the United States to cover the event, but Rector had already secured an exclusive right to picture the event.\nThe film was shot in widescreen format on 2 3/16 gauge film stock. Rector brought 48,000 feet of film stock, the largest amount that had ever been brought on location, and exposed 11,000 feet of it. The night before the match, Stuart cut the ring down from 24 feet to 22 feet for the sake of the camera, but the referee noticed this and Stuart was forced to change it back.\nWyatt Earp was a reporter for The New York World at the time, which published his commentaries on the fight on March 14 and March 18. He disagreed with referee George Siler's decision when Fitzsimmons allegedly hit Corbett in the jaw, which should have resulted in a foul, coming after a knockout blow to Corbett's solar plexus. The World heavily promoted the film, and the day after the film's release, printed a statement from Fitzsimmons, \"I don't believe there is a single picture in it that will substantiate those [claims] published in The World.\"",

It tells the story of a lower-class girl who insinuates herself into an upper class family, only to see her life and the lives of those around her destroyed. The ruthless, self-willed and beautiful Becky is one of the most famous characters in English literature. After the tremendous success of the short La Cucaracha in 1934, John Hay Whitney and his cousin Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney formed Pioneer Pictures to produce color films, of which this was the first. Being the first Technicolor film, the color at the time did not look too realistic; one critic commented that the cast looked like \"boiled salmon dipped in mayonnaise\".",

        "description": "The Monster is a 1925 American silent horror comedy film directed by Roland West, based on the play by Crane Wilbur, and starring Lon Chaney and Johnny Arthur. It is remembered as an antecedental \"old dark house\" movie, as well as a precedent to a number of horror film subgenres. The film has been shown on the TCM network with an alternative, uncredited musical score. Roland West went on to direct The Bat (1926) and its later sound remake The Bat Whispers (1930).\nSynopsis\nJohn Bowman, a wealthy farmer, is kidnapped one night after two mysterious men lure his car off the road. When the wreckage is discovered the next day, constable Russ Mason (Charles Sellon) forms a search party with Amos Rugg (Hallam Cooley) and Johnny Goodlittle (Johnny Arthur).\nAmos and Johnny work at the general store in Danburg. They are in love with Betty Watson (Gertrude Olmstead), the storeowner's daughter. Attempting to woo Betty, Amos invites her on a drive in the country. Meanwhile, Johnny has followed a mysterious stranger to the country. The strange man has lured Amos' car off the road and kidnapped the couple. Johnny accidentally enters a hidden tunnel, and all three end up at Dr Edwards' Sanitarium.\nOnce inside, they are greeted by Dr Gustave Ziska (Lon Chaney), who introduces Rigo (George Austin), Caliban (Walter James), and Daffy Dan (Knute Erickson), his patients. Ziska explains that he took control of the asylum after it had closed. After many attempts to expunge the three hostages, they are captured and sent to a dungeon, wherein Johnny finds Dr Edwards and John Bowman kidnapped by Ziska and his cronies.\nDr Edwards tells Johnny that Ziska, Caliban, Rigo and Daffy Dan were once his patients at the sanitarium. Ziska had been a great surgeon who went mad and began to perform unorthodox operations. He now intends to perform experiments on Betty and Amos, to discover the secret of eternal life.\nAmos and Johnny are captured and brought to Ziska's laboratory, where Betty lies fastened to a surgical bed. Amos is strapped to the \"death chair\" and connected to Betty through a transducer, which will exchange their souls. Johnny eludes Ziska's henchmen and escapes to the roof, sending up flares which are seen by policemen investigating the wreckage of Amos' car.\nHaving escaped, Johnny masquerades as Rigo and begins to assist the doctor. He frees Betty and Amos and straps Ziska to the death chair. Caliban appears and, mistaking the figure in the chair as Amos, activates the transducer, removing Ziska's soul from his body. Because there is no one on the surgical bed, there is no soul to complete the exchange, and he is rendered lifeless.\nRealizing his mistake, Caliban is distracted and Johnny captures him. The policemen enter the laboratory to find that Johnny has successfully apprehended the madmen and located the missing persons. This is enough to gain him respect as an amateur detective, and to win Betty's heart and hand.\nCast\nLon Chaney as Dr. Gustave Ziska\nJohnny Arthur as Johnny Goodlittle\nGertrude Olmstead as Betty Watson\nHallam Cooley as Amos Rugg\nCharles Sellon as Russ Mason, a constable\nWalter James as Caliban\nKnute Erickson as Daffy Dan\nGeorge Austin as Rigo\nEdward McWade as Luke Watson, Betty's father\nEthel Wales as Mrs Watson, Betty's mother\nHerbert Prior as Doctor Edwards\nMatthew Betz as Detective Jennings",

The story begins with Charlie, playing music to raise money, and instead finds the abused girl (played by Edna) living in a gypsy camp. As in The Tramp, he works on finding a way to help her. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0007507/ Watch more Chaplin films",

He meets a beautiful model, Trilby, and becomes infatuated with her, but she, in turn, falls for a young artist called Billee who also loves her. One day Svengali hypnotizes Trilby to cure her headache, but also examines her upper palate and decides it is an ideal cavity for great singing. He convinces her to fake her suicide, so Billee and friends will forget her, and goes on a singing tour with her. Svengali uses his powers to make her sing wonderfully and Madame Svengali, as Trilby is now known, becomes a sensation throughout Europe. But Billee discovers the ruse and begins to follow the pair, upsetting Svengali enough to have him cancel performances too frequently, so they no longer can perform in Europe. They go to Egypt, but Billee relentlessly follows",

The film is said to have influenced the Oscar-winning 1931 Western Cimarron, which also depicts the land rush. In the Cherokee Strip of Oklahoma during the 1880's and early 1890's, the government lands that were leased to cattlemen were opened to settlement by homesteaders. To allow a fair chance for everyone, the prospective homesteaders were required to register and registrants were prohibited from entering into the Strip before the appointed time. Those who tried to get there beforehand were called \"Sooners\". Hence the nickname of Oklahoma is the Sooner State. When a cannon shot signaled the start of the land rush, a hundred thousand men and women tried to stake their claims. This was William S. Hart's last film. Dec.6 1864 -- June 23 1946.",

IMDB page: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040829/ Two years after the accidental death of her husband, Christine Faber (Lynn Bari) is trying to put her life back together and move forward. However, strange events lead her to believe that her husband is attempting to communicate with her, so she proceeds to consult the psychic Alexis (Turhan Bey). This worries her sister and her fiance, who suspect Alexis of being a crook and decide to prove so. This version (fetched from www.publicdomaintorrents.com) is brighter than the two versions already available on the archive, and does better justice to Alton's work. However, about a dozen seconds of the title scene are missing, so the nice piece of music that opens the film is truncated.",

        "description": "Go West is an American silent movie starring Buster Keaton.\nKeaton portrays Friendless, who travels west to try to make his fortune. Once there, he tries his hand at bronco-busting, cattle wrangling and dairy farming, eventually forming a bond with a cow named \"Brown Eyes.\" Eventually he finds himself leading a herd of cattle through Los Angeles.\nPlot\nA drifter identified only as \"Friendless\" (Keaton) sells the last of his possessions, keeping only a few trinkets and a picture of his mother. The money buys him only some bread and a sausage then is gone.\nUnable to find a job in the city, he stows away on a train. He thinks it is going to New York but it is heading west. He sleeps in a barrel but the barrel rolls of the train. He manages to get a job at a cattle ranch despite having no experience. Meanwhile, a neglected cow named Brown Eyes fails to give milk and is sent out to the field along with the other cattle intended for slaughter.\nAs Friendless tries to figure out how to milk a cow, he's told to go out and help the other ranch hands bring in the cattle. Unsuccessful in riding a horse, he falls off and sees Brown Eyes. Noticing her limp, Friendless examines her hoof and removes the rock that had been hurting her. Brown Eyes proceeds to follow Friendless around, saving him from a bull attack. Realizing that he's finally found a companion, Friendless strikes up a friendship with the cow, giving her his blanket at night and attempting to protect her from wild dogs. The next day, Brown Eyes follows Friendless everywhere, much to the chagrin of the other ranch hands. Friendless accidentally sets two steers loose after they'd been corralled in, but on the joking suggestion of the other hands, brings them back in by waving his red bandanna.\nThe ranch owner (Truesdale) and his daughter (Myers) are preparing to sell the cattle to a stockyard, though another rancher wants to hold out for a higher price. The owner, no longer wanting to wait, prepares to ship the whole herd out. Friendless, shocked to hear that Brown Eyes will go to a slaughterhouse, refuses to let her go. The ranch owner fires him and gives him his wages. Friendless tries to buy his friend back with his earnings, but is told that it's not enough. After failing to get more money from a card game, he joins Brown Eyes in the cattle car and tries to find a way to free her. The train is ambushed by the other rancher and his men. Friendless and the ranch owner's other hands manage to drive off the attackers, but only Friendless makes it back to the train as the others chase away the rancher.\nArriving in Los Angeles, Friendless frees Brown Eyes and leads her away, using his red bandana once more to guide the other thousand steers to the stockyard. The townspeople are terrified of the cattle as some of the cows break away and begin entering the stores, but Friendless manages to corral them together. Friendless ties Brown Eyes up before going back to retrieve the other cattle, leaving his red bandana with her in order to keep her cool. Realizing his mistake, he enters a masquerade store to find something red to attract the cows. Deciding on a red devil's outfit, he exits the store and the cattle begin to chase him. The police attempt to arrest him, but are mistakenly sprayed with hoses from the fire department, who flee once they see the cattle coming.\nThe ranch owner, realizing his ruin if the cattle are not sold, drives with his daughter to the stockyard. The owner tells him that no cattle have arrived yet. Defeated, the ranch owner prepares to leave when he sees Friendless leading the herd into the stockyard. Overjoyed, the ranch owner tells Friendless that his house and anything he owns is his to ask for. Friendless says that he only wants \"her,\" gesturing behind him to where the ranch owner's daughter is. The owner is surprised and the daughter flattered, but they quickly realize that it's Brown Eyes that he's referring to. The three drive back to the ranch, with Brown Eyes beside Friendless in the back seat.\nCast\nBuster Keaton - Friendless\nHoward Truesdale - Ranch owner\nKathleen Myers - Ranch owner's daughter\nRay Thompson - Ranch foreman\nBrown Eyes - The Cow 'Brown Eyes'\nRoscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle - Woman in department store (uncredited)\nJoe Keaton - Man in Barber Shop (uncredited)\nGus Leonard - General store owner (uncredited)\nBabe London - Woman in department store (uncredited)",

        "description": "The Man with the Golden Arm is a 1955 American drama film with elements of film noir, based on the novel of the same name by Nelson Algren, which tells the story of a drug addict who gets clean while in prison, but struggles to stay that way in the outside world. Although the addictive drug is never identified in the film, according to the American Film Institute \"most contemporary and modern sources assume that it is heroin\", in contrast to Algren's book which named the drug as morphine. The film stars Frank Sinatra, Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang and Darren McGavin. It was adapted for the screen by Walter Newman, Lewis Meltzer and Ben Hecht (uncredited), and directed by Otto Preminger. The film's initial release sparked controversy due to its serious, in-depth treatment of the then-taboo subject of drug addiction.\nIt was nominated for three Academy Awards: Sinatra for Best Actor in a Leading Role, Joseph C. Wright and Darrell Silvera for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White and Elmer Bernstein for Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture. Sinatra was also nominated for best actor awards by the BAFTAs and The New York Film Critics. The film is in the public domain.\nPlot\nFrankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) is released from the Lexington Federal Medical Center with a set of drums and a new outlook on life, and returns to his run-down neighborhood on the North Side of Chicago. A drug addict (the drug is never named, but heroin is strongly implied), Frankie became clean in prison. On the outside, he greets friends and acquaintances. Sparrow (Arnold Stang), who runs a con selling homeless dogs, clings to him like a young brother, but Schwiefka (Robert Strauss), whom Frankie used to deal for in his illegal card game, has more sinister reasons for welcoming him back, as does Louie (Darren McGavin), Machine's former drug dealer.\nFrankie returns home to his wife Zosh (Eleanor Parker), who is supposedly wheelchair-bound after a car crash some years earlier that was caused by Frankie driving drunk. Zosh is secretly fully recovered, but pretends to be unable to walk in order to keep making Frankie feel guilty so he will stay with her. Frankie comments on the whistle she wears around her neck, a device she used in Frankie's absence to summon a neighbor, Vi (Doro Merande), when needed. With Frankie home, Zosh smothers her husband in their small tenement apartment and hinders his attempt to make something of himself. He thinks he has what it takes to play drums for a big band. While calling to make an appointment, he bumps into an old flame, Molly (Kim Novak) who works in a local strip joint as a hostess and lives in the apartment below Frankie's. Unlike Zosh, Molly encourages his dream of becoming a drummer.\nFrankie soon gets himself a tryout and asks Sparrow to get him a new suit, but the suit is a stolen one and he ends up back in a cell at a local Chicago Police Precinct. Schwiefka offers to pay the bail. Frankie refuses, but soon changes his mind when the sight of a drug addict on the edge becomes too much for him. Now, to repay the debt, he must deal cards for Schwiefka again. Louie is trying to hook him on drugs again, and with no job and Zosh to please, pressure is building from all directions.\nSoon Frankie succumbs and is back on drugs and dealing marathon all-night card games for Schwiefka. Molly sees he is using drugs again and runs away from him. He gets a tryout as a drummer, but spends 24 hours straight dealing a poker game. Desperately needing a fix, Frankie follows Louie home, attacks him, and ransacks his house, but can't find his drug stash. At the audition, with withdrawal coming on, Frankie can't keep the beat and ruins his chance of landing the drumming job. When Louie goes to see Zosh to try to find Frankie, Louie discovers that Zosh has been faking her paralysis and can walk. Zosh, scared of being found out, pushes Louie over the railing of the stairwell to his death, but things backfire when Frankie is sought for Louie's murder.\nInitially not realizing he is a suspect in Louie's death, Frankie goes to Molly hoping to get money for a fix. After learning that Captain Bednar and the police are looking for him, Molly convinces Frankie that he must go cold turkey if he is to stand a chance with the police. Frankie agrees and is locked in Molly's apartment where he goes through a grueling withdrawal to clear the drugs from his body. Finally clean again, he tells Zosh he is going to leave her, start anew and stand trial. In her desperation to keep Frankie from leaving her, Zosh once again gives herself away, standing up in front of Frankie and the police. She runs, but can get no farther than the outside balcony. Trapped, she blows the whistle and throws herself off the balcony to her death. A police ambulance then arrives to remove Zosh's lifeless body and drives away, while Frankie watches in dismay. He then walks away, with Molly following.\nCast\nFrank Sinatra as Frankie \"Dealer\" Machine\nEleanor Parker as Sophia \"Zosh\" Machine\nKim Novak as Molly Novotny\nArnold Stang as Sparrow\nDarren McGavin as \"Nifty Louie\" Fomorowski\nRobert Strauss as Zero Schwiefka\nJohn Conte as Drunkie John\nDoro Merande as Vi\nGeorge E.

However, production was delayed because the Production Code Authority (PCA) refused to approve the script, with Joseph Breen stating that the basic story was \"unacceptable\" because of the Code's prohibition on showing illegal drug trafficking and drug addiction. The ability to obtain PCA approval was critical because at that time, many movie theaters would not show films that had not received approval. The PCA further predicted that the subject would also be unacceptable to the National Legion of Decency (a Catholic film censor board), Federal authorities, and state and local censor boards in the United States and abroad. Garfield died in 1952 and director Otto Preminger acquired the rights from his estate.\nPreminger had previously released The Moon Is Blue (1953), which succeeded at the box office despite being denied the Production Code seal of approval due to its sexual subject matter.[5] He told Peter Bogdanovich why he was attracted to Algren's novel: \"I think there's a great tragedy in any human being who gets hooked on something, whether it's heroin or love or a woman or whatever.\"[8] Although United Artists (UA) had a distribution contract with Preminger, a clause in the contract allowed them to withdraw if a film failed to get Code approval. Preminger stated that in that event, he would set up his own company to handle distribution of The Man With The Golden Arm. Preminger continued to have problems with the PCA during the making of the film.\nAlthough the novel's author, Nelson Algren, was initially brought to Hollywood to work on the screenplay, he and Preminger did not get along, and he was quickly replaced by Walter Newman. Preminger and Newman went on to make significant changes to Algren's original story, and the film was eventually released as \"A Film By Otto Preminger\". In 1956, Algren sued Preminger and others seeking an injunction to keep Preminger from claiming authorship of the film, but had to drop the suit because he could not afford the legal fees.\nFrank Sinatra jumped at a chance to star in the film before reading the entire script. The script was given to Marlon Brando around the same time as Sinatra, who still harbored some anger at Brando for beating out Sinatra for the lead role in On the Waterfront. To prepare for his role, Sinatra spent time at drug rehabilitation clinics observing addicts going cold turkey. He also learned to play drums from drummer Shelly Manne. The picture was shot in six weeks at RKO Studios in Hollywood from September 26 through November 4, 1955.\nSaul Bass designed the crooked arm symbol used in the film's advertising campaign, which Preminger liked so much that he threatened to pull the picture if an exhibitor changed the advertisements. Bass also created the animated title sequence for the film, the first of many such sequences that he created for films by Preminger, Alfred Hitchcock, and others.\nControversy over release\nPreminger decided to release the finished film prior to submitting it for a Code seal of approval. He contended that his film would not entice any viewers to take drugs, since drug use was depicted as having severely negative consequences. United Artists, which had invested $1 million in the film's production, opted to distribute the film, even though doing so could result in the company being fined $25,000 by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The president of United Artists, Arthur Krim, expressed the company's hope that the PCA would make an exception to its usual rules and grant the film approval because of the film's \u201cimmense potential for public service.\u201d The film received several advance bookings in November and early December 1955, before the PCA had made a decision on whether to grant a Code seal.\nHowever, in early December 1955, the PCA denied the film a Code seal, and the decision was upheld upon appeal to the MPAA. As a result, United Artists resigned from the MPAA that same month (although the company re-joined a few years later). The National Legion of Decency also showed disagreement with the PCA ruling by rating the film as a \"B\" meaning \"morally objectionable in part for all\", instead of a \"C\" meaning \"condemned\", which was the rating normally given to films that were denied a Code seal. Large theater circuits including Loews also refused to ban the film and instead showed it despite the lack of a Code seal. As a result of the controversy, the MPAA investigated and revised production codes, allowing later movies more freedom to deeply explore hitherto taboo subjects such as drug abuse, kidnapping, miscegenation, abortion, and prostitution.\nIn the end, The Man With The Golden Arm finally received the Production Code seal number 17011 in June 1961, which permitted the film to be reissued and sold for television broadcast.",

        "description": "The Unholy Three is a 1925 American silent film involving a crime spree, directed by Tod Browning and starring Lon Chaney. The supporting cast features Mae Busch, Matt Moore, Victor McLaglen and Harry Earles.\nThe film was remade in 1930 as a talkie. In both the 1925 and the 1930 version, the roles of Professor Echo and Tweedledee are played by Chaney and Earles respectively. The films were based on the novel of the same name by Tod Robbins.\nPlot\nThree performers leave a sideshow after Tweedledee (Harry Earles), a midget performer, assaults a young heckler and sparks a melee. The three join together in an \"unholy\" plan to become wealthy. Prof. Echo, the ventriloquist, assumes the role of Mrs. O'Grady, a kindly old grandmother, who runs a pet shop, while Tweedledee plays her grandchild. Hercules (Victor McLaglen), the strongman, works in the shop along with the unsuspecting Hector McDonald (Matt Moore). Echo's girlfriend, pickpocket Rosie O'Grady (Mae Busch), pretends to be his granddaughter.\nUsing what they learn from delivering pets, the trio later commit burglaries, with their wealthy buyers as victims. On Christmas Eve, John Arlington (an uncredited Charles Wellesley) telephones to complain that the \"talking\" parrot (aided by Echo's ventriloquism) he bought will not speak. When \"Granny\" O'Grady visits him to coax the bird into performing, \"she\" takes along grandson \"Little Willie\". While there, they learn that a valuable ruby necklace is in the house. They decide to steal it that night. As Echo is too busy, the other two grow impatient and decide to go ahead without him.\nThe next day, Echo is furious to read in the newspaper that Arlington was killed and his three-year-old daughter badly injured in the robbery. Hercules shows no remorse whatsoever, relating how Arlington pleaded for his life. When a police investigator shows up at the shop, the trio become fearful and decide to frame Hector, hiding the jewelry in his room.\nMeanwhile, Hector proposes to Rosie. She turns him down, but he overhears her crying after he leaves. To his joy, she confesses she loves him, but was ashamed of her shady past. When the police take him away, Rosie tells the trio that she will exonerate him, forcing them to abduct her and flee to a mountain cabin. Echo takes along his large pet ape (who terrifies Hercules).\nIn the spring, Hector is brought to trial. Rosie pleads with Echo to save Hector, promising to stay with him if he does. After Echo leaves for the city, Tweedledee overhears Hercules asking Rosie to run away with him (and the loot). Tweedledee releases the ape. Hercules kills Tweedledee right before the ape gets him.\nAt the trial, Echo agonizes over what to do, but finally rushes forward and confesses all. Both he and Hector are set free. When Rosie goes to Echo to keep her promise, he lies and says he was only kidding. He tells her to go to Hector. Echo returns to the sideshow, giving his spiel to the customers: \"That's all there is to life, friends, ... a little laughter ... a little tear.\"\nThemes\nAs is common of a Tod Browning film, circus life and unusual bodies play a central role in this movie along with great use of trompe-l'\u0153il optical illusion. Trompe-l'\u0153il is exercised and played with as the illusion of Dr. Echo as \"Mrs. O\u2019Grady\" and Tweedledee as \"Little Willie\". The main plot of the movie revolves around the character\u2019s abilities to pass themselves off convincingly as something they are not, an illusion the movie peels back and reasserts for both the other characters and for the audience themselves. Contrary to the usual use of this effect, Browning makes it a point to disillusion the audience and display the workings of the illusion to create a different sort of viewing stimulation.\nIn most Browning films, his opinion of the deformed and different becomes evident. The three\u2019s plot plays directly with another of Browning\u2019s favorite topics, dealing with identity, doubles, dual roles, and deformity. This film is unique in that the character Tweedledee is the only one of this group of that is played by a deformed character and is malicious in nature.\nCast\nLon Chaney as Prof. Echo, a.k.a. Mrs. O'Grady or \"Granny\"\nMae Busch as Rosie O'Grady\nMatt Moore as Hector McDonald\nVictor McLaglen as Hercules, a.k.a. \"Son-in-Law\"\nHarry Earles as Tweedledee, a.k.a.

        "description": "No more uploads I was very satisfied with FTP uploading at archive.org. I was able to see exactly how much of the upload had been completed. I was able to see the rate at which the upload was progressing. And, perhaps most important of all, I was able to resume an interrupted upload. In other words, if I had uploaded 90% of a file when the connection was lost, all I had to do was reconnect and upload the remaining 10%. The programmers at archive.org have eliminated the best way of uploading, uploading via FTP. They have decided to force everyone to use an inferior, cruder method. The programmers at archive.org want you to be completely dependent upon and at the mercy of Adobe Corporation; in other words, they want you to use the Flash uploader. When using the Flash uploader, there is a progress indicator that gives only a very rough idea of how much of the file has been uploaded. There is nothing to indicate the rate at which the upload is progressing. There is no way to resume an interrupted upload. The Flash uploader is much more primitive than uploading by FTP. When attempting to use the non-flash uploader, this message appears: \"Unfortunately we do not have upload progress feedback while files transfer during this (non-flash) method.\" And, of course, there is no way to resume an interrupted upload. Unbelievably crude. But the incompetent programmers at archive.org will probably tell you that the non-FTP methods of uploading are \"way kewl\" and have lots of nifty blinking lights. When the programmers at archive.org removed the best way of uploading, they didn't make it easier to upload. They made it harder. They probably resented that the best way made their ways seem so clunky by comparison. And they felt that they needed to make it appear that they were earning their paychecks by making some sort of an \"improvement\". It seems that they have no interest in making things easier for contributors to archive.org and that they are only interested in making things easier for themselves. I have uploaded over 200 videos (feature films and television shows) to archive.org. Since the programmers at archive.org have used their time to sabotage FTP uploading, I will be unable to upload any more videos.\n \n\n\nSteve McQueen stars in a gritty, downbeat, and sometimes savage heist movie that features a gang of very psychologically warped men and a story that's based on an actual crime. Warning: this film is devoid of humor, wit, cheerfulness, glamor, and mercy. It's grim to the brim. Some will find that viewing it is an unpleasant experience.\n\n\n\n This movie is in the public domain. Video-Cellar wrote: The film was originally published without a notice, but most prints currently in circulation are later television syndication prints which had a super'd copyright notice on the end. The renewal would be effectively invalid on that basis alone, but when you add the renewing party \"Film World International\" was one of those companies that tried to renew films they didn't really own before they entered the PD, it is completely invalid. They also tried this with \"The Proud Rebel\", \"The Deep Six\" and \"Lonelyhearts\". Only problem was that Alan Ladd Enterprises (Deep Six) and Schary Productions (Lonelyhearts) also applied for renewals and FWI got found out. Don't ask me why the copyright office keeps the records of the fraudulent claims on file.",

I was able to see the rate at which the upload was progressing. And, perhaps most important of all, I was able to resume an interrupted upload. In other words, if I had uploaded 90% of a file when the connection was lost, all I had to do was reconnect and upload the remaining 10%. The programmers at archive.org have eliminated the best way of uploading, uploading via FTP. They have decided to force everyone to use an inferior, cruder method. The programmers at archive.org want you to be completely dependent upon and at the mercy of Adobe Corporation; in other words, they want you to use the Flash uploader. When using the Flash uploader, there is a progress indicator that gives only a very rough idea of how much of the file has been uploaded. There is nothing to indicate the rate at which the upload is progressing. There is no way to resume an interrupted upload. The Flash uploader is much more primitive than uploading by FTP. When attempting to use the non-flash uploader, this message appears: \"Unfortunately we do not have upload progress feedback while files transfer during this (non-flash) method.\" And, of course, there is no way to resume an interrupted upload. Unbelievably crude. But the incompetent programmers at archive.org will probably tell you that the non-FTP methods of uploading are \"way kewl\" and have lots of nifty blinking lights. When the programmers at archive.org removed the best way of uploading, they didn't make it easier to upload. They made it harder. They probably resented that the best way made their ways seem so clunky by comparison. And they felt that they needed to make it appear that they were earning their paychecks by making some sort of an \"improvement\". It seems that they have no interest in making things easier for contributors to archive.org and that they are only interested in making things easier for themselves. I have uploaded over 200 videos (feature films and television shows) to archive.org. Since the programmers at archive.org have used their time to sabotage FTP uploading, I will be unable to upload any more videos. Smaller than the other available downloads, but still high quality.",

About 15 seconds after he gets the cash, he's lured away on a false pretence and robbed by Conrad's henchmen. Newspaper reporter Jerry Mason (Lawrence Gray) witnesses the robbery and steals the cash from Conrad. Conrad's thugs (all of whom have mustaches and crisp suits) chase him into his friend Fred Klein (Fuzzy Knight)'s delicatessen. The two of them get taken back to Conrad and forced to talk. After fighting their way out of the Green Eagle Cafe again, they hightail it to Jerry's newspaper and tell the world (and the police) about Conrad's true profession. Afterwards Conrad and his henchmen try one gambit after another to get the money back. [Synopsis by uniQ.] You can find more information regarding this film on its IMDb page.",

He hides out with Li Fang, a Chinese politician and former friend of Webster's. In order to move about the city undetected, he disguises himself as a cripple, dragging himself about on a pair of crutches. At a local mission, he meets his daughter, a young girl known as \"The Angel Lady\" because of her many kindly deeds and good works. She befriends the cripple, unaware of his identity, and the two play songs together, he on violin and the girl on piano. Detective Doyle is determined to capture Webster and, learning that Li Fang knows his whereabouts, gives the Chinaman the third degree until he reveals his identity. Webster breaks in on Burton and forces him into signing a confession stating that he framed Webster; however, his victory is a hollow one, as he learns that his daughter plans to marry Ted Burton, the son of the elder Burton. Realizing that the imprisonment of Burton would ruin the son and destroy his daughter's happiness, Webster destroys Burton's confession and returns to prison. Stars Lon Chaney",

As if from out of space there slowly appears a perfect and lifelike picture of Abraham Lincoln. The forming of the picture is first noticed by the appearance of what seems to be a mere spot on the front of the altar. This spot slowly enlarges and is focused into shape, until, to the amazement of the audience, the face of the great emancipator is clearly shown. President Lincoln's likeness is allowed to remain upon the altar just long enough for recognition, when, in the same mysterious manner that it appeared, it slowly fades and in its place their grows the picture of President Garfield. This in a like manner fades away, and again as out of the dim distance comes the picture of our great martyred President, William McKinley. The tableau is then dissolved into a picture of an assassin kneeling before the throne of Justice. Here the tableau ends, leaving an impression of mingled sorrow and sublimity upon the audience.\" A film in Library of Congress Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division",

        "description": "The Extra Girl is a 1923 American silent comedy film directed by F. Richard Jones and starring Mabel Normand. Produced by Mack Sennett, The Extra Girl followed earlier films about the film industry and also paved the way for later films about Hollywood, such as King Vidor\u2019s Show People (1928). It was still unusual in 1923 for filmmakers to make a film about the southern California film industry, then little more than ten years old. Still, many of the Hollywood clich\u00e9s of small town girls travelling to Hollywood to become film stars are here to reinforce the myths of Tinseltown.\nSue Graham (Normand) is a small town girl who travels to Hollywood to escape marriage, and in the hope of becoming a motion picture star. She wins a contract with a studio on the strength of a picture of a quite different (and very attractive) girl sent instead of hers; but when she arrives the mistake is discovered. Since the error was the result of another\u2019s deception, the studio manager agrees to give her a job in the costume department. She eventually gets the opportunity to screen test, but it turns out disastrously \u2013 although in a nod to the actress behind the character the director calls her \"a natural comedian.\" Sue's parents come out to California, and invest money with a shifty individual who swindles them out of their life savings. Sue and childhood friend Dave, who has also followed her, retrieve the money. Despite the unsuccessful film career, all turns out well.\nCast\nMabel Normand as Sue Graham\nGeorge Nichols as Zachariah \"Pa\" Graham\nAnna Dodge as Mary \"Ma\" Graham (credited as Anna Hernandez)\nRalph Graves as Dave Giddings\nVernon Dent as Aaron Applejohn\nRamsey Wallace as T.

French as Studio Manager (uncredited)\nNuma the Lion as Numa (uncredited)\nJackie Lucas as Son (uncredited)\nEric Mayne as Lion Film Director (uncredited)\nElsie Tarron as Actress (uncredited)\nActors Billy Bevan and William Desmond appear as themselves. Producer Mack Sennett can be glimpsed briefly as a straw-hatted onlooker at Sue's screen test.\nProduction\nDirected by F. Richard Jones, the film features several shots of semi-rural Southern California (the Edendale area along present-day Glendale Boulevard, where Sennett's studio was located) showing houses and streets of the early 1920s, and of a Hollywood studio in action. One shot in particular, a high-angle view, shows a film set, with actors, two cameras and operators, several production people, and a mood orchestra composed of a pianist and violinist, to set the proper mood for the actors. Another shows an open stage with crew scrambling up scaffolding to the sunlight diffusing panels above.\nThe Extra Girl was Normand's final feature film and her last film working with producer Sennett.",

The film was based on a best-selling novel from 1924 of the same name, written by Percy Marks, a Brown University English instructor who chronicled the life of the fast-set of that university and used the fictitious Sanford College as a backdrop. The Plastic Age is known to most silent film fans as the very first hit of Clara Bow's career, and helped jumpstart her fast rise to stardom. Frederica Sagor Maas and Eve Unsell adapted the book for the screen.\nPlot\nHugh Carver (Donald Keith) is an athletic star and a freshman at Prescott College. During a hazing initiation by his fraternity brothers, he meets Cynthia Day (Clara Bow), a popular girl who loves to party and have a good time. She introduces him to the pleasures of illicit drinking, dancing at illegal roadhouses, and getting nasty in the back seats of cars. A love-triangle develops between Day, Carver, and Carver's roommate, Carl Peters (Gilbert Roland), who also likes Day. Eventually, Peters gives up his crush on Day and reconciles his friendship with Carver.\nCarver's grades, athletic performance and moral character begin to suffer as a result of his late nights and wild partying, and on a visit home, his strict father tosses him out of the house and tells him not to come back until he's 'made good'. After almost being arrested at a roadhouse raid, Day and Carver escape in her automobile, and Day realizes that her lifestyle is bad for Carver, so the two stop seeing each other.\nCarver's school performance then improves greatly, and he leads his teammates to victory at the big football game at the end of the year. Peters tells Carver that Day still loves him, and that she has changed, becoming less wild and more mature. Day and Carver are reunited at the end.",

Peterson says it is a waste of time trying to find something incriminating to bring Mr. Brown to justice because his crime combo does business without accounting books, and furthermore Peterson says Diamond's actual motivation is Diamond's love for Brown's girlfriend Susan Lowell (Jean Wallace). Susan is attended to at all time by Brown's thugs Mingo (Earl Holliman) and Fante (Lee Van Cleef). Seemingly drawn to Brown through his ability to inflict pain, she seems kidnapped and yet willingly waits for Brown's brutal attentions.

But he also had a brief Hollywood heyday during the mid 1940s, when he made some of his best films. Scarlet Street has been claimed by film noir. This attribution is understandable. The lighting is dark, with heavy use of shadows. The characters are all shady as well. Kitty is certainly a femme fatale, although hints are dropped that she is an inherently decent person who has become completely corrupted by Johnny. Being the most naive, Robinson is also the most sympathetic. But even he eventually turns to crime to fulfill his passions. But while Scarlet Street has elements of film noir, it is in reality a black comedy. While Robinson plays it straight throughout, Bennett and Duryea camp it up marvelously. Bennett laughs when Robinson claims to be a painter: \"And here I had you pegged as a cashier!\" She also has to suppress laughter when Robinson reveals that he is married, and shock when Duryea passes her off as the mysterious painter.",

His sister Jeanne plays Kitty Duval, a woman who claims to once have been in burlesque. She and her brother have some of the most touching scenes in the movie. The pace takes a while to get used to but if you're in the mood for something optimistically offbeat, The Time of Your Life should be up your alley.",

By now, the butler is loose and calls for the police, but Farina ups the ante by calling on the fire department and an ambulance as well.

        "subject": null,
        "description": "Beau Brummel is a 1924 American silent film historical drama starring John Barrymore and Mary Astor. The film was directed by Harry Beaumont and based upon Clyde Fitch's 1890 play, which had been performed by Richard Mansfield, and depicts the life of the British Regency dandy Beau Brummell.\nSeveral years after Barrymore's death, his daughter Diana Barrymore was shown a special screening of this film as she had never seen her father in any of his silent films.\nIn 1952, the film entered the public domain in the United States because Warner Bros. did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.\nPlot\nIn 1795, the cream of English aristocracy attend the wedding of \"tradesman's daughter\" Margery. She loves Beau Brummel, a penniless captain in the Tenth Hussars, but has been pressured into agreeing to marry Lord Alvanley, exchanging her family's wealth for social standing and a title. When Brummel comes to see her just before the wedding, she begs him to take her away, but her ambitious mother, Mrs. Wertham, intervenes, and Margery gives way. Embittered, Brummel decides to seek revenge against society using his \"charm, wit and personal appearance\".\nAt a dinner given by the Prince of Wales for the officers of his regiment, the Prince is attracted to Mrs. Snodgrass, the innkeeper's wife. When Brummel rescues him from the irate husband, he takes a great liking to the captain, enabling Brummel to attach himself to His Royal Highness.\nBy 1811, Brummel has made his house in London the \"rendezvous of the smart world\" and himself the arbiter of fashion. When Lord Henry Stanhope catches him dallying with his infatuated wife, a duel ensues. Lord Henry misses, whereupon Brummel fires his pistol into the air. Afterward, however, Brummel informs Lady Hester Stanhope that he never loved her. She attracts the attention of the womanizing Prince.\nShe and another enemy he has made set out to turn the Prince against him. Brummel unwittingly helps them, having become too sure of his position; he is rude to his royal friend. Brummel turns his attentions to the Duchess of York, the Prince's sister-in-law. She agrees to a late night private supper, but Lady Margery shows up first. She warns him that his enemies are hard at work; one knows about the rendezvous. The Prince arrives unannounced, expecting to find the Duchess, but is (pleasantly) surprised to find Lady Margery instead. When she rejects his initial advances, he offers to appoint Brummel the Ambassador to France. Lady Margery is delighted at the prospect, but it is all for naught. Shortly afterward, the two men quarrel openly, and neither is interested in a reconciliation.\nNo longer able to fend off his creditors as a result of the withdrawal of the Prince's favor, Brummel flees to Calais to avoid going to debtors prison, accompanied only by his loyal butler Mortimer. Years pass, and the Prince, now King George IV, stops at Calais. In his entourage is Lady Margery. Both see Brummel standing by the side of the road. Without his master's knowledge, Mortimer goes to see the King, pretending to represent Brummel in an effort to heal the breach. When Brummel finds out, he discharges Mortimer. Lady Margery comes to see Brummel in his garret. Her husband has died, and she asks him to marry her. He turns her down, saying he is too worn out and tired, perhaps even of love. After she departs, his resolution wavers, but he regains control of himself.\nIn old age, Brummel ends up in the hospital prison of Bon Saveur. The ever-faithful Mortimer visits him, but Brummel's mind has deteriorated - he does not recognize his old servant at first. Mortimer informs him that the King has died and that Lady Margery is very ill. The scene shifts to the latter's bed. Her spirit leaves her body and travels to Brummel's cell. When Brummel also dies, their youthful souls are joyfully reunited.\nCast\nJohn Barrymore as George Bryan \"Beau\" Brummel\nMary Astor as Lady Margery Alvanley\nWillard Louis as Prince of Wales\nCarmel Myers as Lady Hester Stanhope\nIrene Rich as Frederica Charlotte, Duchess of York, sister-in-law of the Prince of Wales\nAlec B.

H. Chaldecotte as Timothy\nF. F. Guenste as Parkyns, valet to the Prince of Wales\nBeaudine Anderson as child (uncredited)\nProduction\nShooting on the film began in September 1923.\nBarrymore and Astor were conducting an affair during filming.\nBarrymore and Willard Louis, who played the Prince of Wales, frequently told bawdy jokes rather than say their lines, since it was a silent film. However, they did not take into account deaf audience members who could lip read what they were saying. Many of these patrons wrote to complain about the actors' antics.\nThe picture was a remake of a 1913 version and was in turn remade in 1954 with Stewart Granger, Elizabeth Taylor and Peter Ustinov, although the latter film restored the original spelling of \"Brummell.\"",

        "description": "Go West is an American silent movie starring Buster Keaton.\nKeaton portrays Friendless, who travels west to try to make his fortune. Once there, he tries his hand at bronco-busting, cattle wrangling and dairy farming, eventually forming a bond with a cow named \"Brown Eyes.\" Eventually he finds himself leading a herd of cattle through Los Angeles.\nPlot\nA drifter identified only as \"Friendless\" (Keaton) sells the last of his possessions, keeping only a few trinkets and a picture of his mother. The money buys him only some bread and a sausage then is gone.\nUnable to find a job in the city, he stows away on a train. He thinks it is going to New York but it is heading west. He sleeps in a barrel but the barrel rolls of the train. He manages to get a job at a cattle ranch despite having no experience. Meanwhile, a neglected cow named Brown Eyes fails to give milk and is sent out to the field along with the other cattle intended for slaughter.\nAs Friendless tries to figure out how to milk a cow, he's told to go out and help the other ranch hands bring in the cattle. Unsuccessful in riding a horse, he falls off and sees Brown Eyes. Noticing her limp, Friendless examines her hoof and removes the rock that had been hurting her. Brown Eyes proceeds to follow Friendless around, saving him from a bull attack. Realizing that he's finally found a companion, Friendless strikes up a friendship with the cow, giving her his blanket at night and attempting to protect her from wild dogs. The next day, Brown Eyes follows Friendless everywhere, much to the chagrin of the other ranch hands. Friendless accidentally sets two steers loose after they'd been corralled in, but on the joking suggestion of the other hands, brings them back in by waving his red bandanna.\nThe ranch owner (Truesdale) and his daughter (Myers) are preparing to sell the cattle to a stockyard, though another rancher wants to hold out for a higher price. The owner, no longer wanting to wait, prepares to ship the whole herd out. Friendless, shocked to hear that Brown Eyes will go to a slaughterhouse, refuses to let her go. The ranch owner fires him and gives him his wages. Friendless tries to buy his friend back with his earnings, but is told that it's not enough. After failing to get more money from a card game, he joins Brown Eyes in the cattle car and tries to find a way to free her. The train is ambushed by the other rancher and his men. Friendless and the ranch owner's other hands manage to drive off the attackers, but only Friendless makes it back to the train as the others chase away the rancher.\nArriving in Los Angeles, Friendless frees Brown Eyes and leads her away, using his red bandana once more to guide the other thousand steers to the stockyard. The townspeople are terrified of the cattle as some of the cows break away and begin entering the stores, but Friendless manages to corral them together. Friendless ties Brown Eyes up before going back to retrieve the other cattle, leaving his red bandana with her in order to keep her cool. Realizing his mistake, he enters a masquerade store to find something red to attract the cows. Deciding on a red devil's outfit, he exits the store and the cattle begin to chase him. The police attempt to arrest him, but are mistakenly sprayed with hoses from the fire department, who flee once they see the cattle coming.\nThe ranch owner, realizing his ruin if the cattle are not sold, drives with his daughter to the stockyard. The owner tells him that no cattle have arrived yet. Defeated, the ranch owner prepares to leave when he sees Friendless leading the herd into the stockyard. Overjoyed, the ranch owner tells Friendless that his house and anything he owns is his to ask for. Friendless says that he only wants \"her,\" gesturing behind him to where the ranch owner's daughter is. The owner is surprised and the daughter flattered, but they quickly realize that it's Brown Eyes that he's referring to. The three drive back to the ranch, with Brown Eyes beside Friendless in the back seat.\nCast\nBuster Keaton - Friendless\nHoward Truesdale - Ranch owner\nKathleen Myers - Ranch owner's daughter\nRay Thompson - Ranch foreman\nBrown Eyes - The Cow 'Brown Eyes'\nRoscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle - Woman in department store (uncredited)\nJoe Keaton - Man in Barber Shop (uncredited)\nGus Leonard - General store owner (uncredited)\nBabe London - Woman in department store (uncredited)",

        "description": "The Monster is a 1925 American silent horror comedy film directed by Roland West, based on the play by Crane Wilbur, and starring Lon Chaney and Johnny Arthur. It is remembered as an antecedental \"old dark house\" movie, as well as a precedent to a number of horror film subgenres. The film has been shown on the TCM network with an alternative, uncredited musical score. Roland West went on to direct The Bat (1926) and its later sound remake The Bat Whispers (1930).\nSynopsis\nJohn Bowman, a wealthy farmer, is kidnapped one night after two mysterious men lure his car off the road. When the wreckage is discovered the next day, constable Russ Mason (Charles Sellon) forms a search party with Amos Rugg (Hallam Cooley) and Johnny Goodlittle (Johnny Arthur).\nAmos and Johnny work at the general store in Danburg. They are in love with Betty Watson (Gertrude Olmstead), the storeowner's daughter. Attempting to woo Betty, Amos invites her on a drive in the country. Meanwhile, Johnny has followed a mysterious stranger to the country. The strange man has lured Amos' car off the road and kidnapped the couple. Johnny accidentally enters a hidden tunnel, and all three end up at Dr Edwards' Sanitarium.\nOnce inside, they are greeted by Dr Gustave Ziska (Lon Chaney), who introduces Rigo (George Austin), Caliban (Walter James), and Daffy Dan (Knute Erickson), his patients. Ziska explains that he took control of the asylum after it had closed. After many attempts to expunge the three hostages, they are captured and sent to a dungeon, wherein Johnny finds Dr Edwards and John Bowman kidnapped by Ziska and his cronies.\nDr Edwards tells Johnny that Ziska, Caliban, Rigo and Daffy Dan were once his patients at the sanitarium. Ziska had been a great surgeon who went mad and began to perform unorthodox operations. He now intends to perform experiments on Betty and Amos, to discover the secret of eternal life.\nAmos and Johnny are captured and brought to Ziska's laboratory, where Betty lies fastened to a surgical bed. Amos is strapped to the \"death chair\" and connected to Betty through a transducer, which will exchange their souls. Johnny eludes Ziska's henchmen and escapes to the roof, sending up flares which are seen by policemen investigating the wreckage of Amos' car.\nHaving escaped, Johnny masquerades as Rigo and begins to assist the doctor. He frees Betty and Amos and straps Ziska to the death chair. Caliban appears and, mistaking the figure in the chair as Amos, activates the transducer, removing Ziska's soul from his body. Because there is no one on the surgical bed, there is no soul to complete the exchange, and he is rendered lifeless.\nRealizing his mistake, Caliban is distracted and Johnny captures him. The policemen enter the laboratory to find that Johnny has successfully apprehended the madmen and located the missing persons. This is enough to gain him respect as an amateur detective, and to win Betty's heart and hand.\nCast\nLon Chaney as Dr. Gustave Ziska\nJohnny Arthur as Johnny Goodlittle\nGertrude Olmstead as Betty Watson\nHallam Cooley as Amos Rugg\nCharles Sellon as Russ Mason, a constable\nWalter James as Caliban\nKnute Erickson as Daffy Dan\nGeorge Austin as Rigo\nEdward McWade as Luke Watson, Betty's father\nEthel Wales as Mrs Watson, Betty's mother\nHerbert Prior as Doctor Edwards\nMatthew Betz as Detective Jennings",

        "description": "From Edison films catalog: A grand spectacular performance in nine scenes and one tableau, illustrating the most popular fairy story ever written.... From this very simple and popular fairy tale we have produced a most pleasing, interesting and mirth producing play in motion pictures, introducing therein many surprising new tricks and dissolving effects. The subject was carefully studied, and every scene posed with a view to following as closely as possible the accepted version of JACK AND THE BEANSTALK. We have, for the purpose of producing comedy (which in reality is the life of any animated picture play), in some instances departed slightly from the story, in that we have burlesqued a few of the features; as, for instance, where the butcher trades the hatful of beans with Jack for his mother's cow, we have introduced a burlesque animal made up of two men covered over with the head, horns and hide of a cow. This animal goes through many ludicrous antics, such as kicking, jig dancing, sitting down with legs crossed, etc., and finally, after strenuous efforts on the part of the butcher, suffers herself to be led away. Scene 1 -- Trading the Cow. Jack's mother, being very poor, has dispatched him to the market to sell her only cow that they may not starve. The good fairy meets the village butcher at the bridge and informs him that Jack will pass that way with a cow which he can doubtless purchase for a hatful of beans, Jack being a very careless and foolish lad. The fairy vanishes, and Jack appears upon the scene leading the cow. The bargain is struck, and Jack runs away to show his mother what he considers a very gratifying price for their beautiful animal. Scene 2 -- Jack Returns with the Beans. Shows Jack's return to his mother's cottage, bringing the beans in his hat, and showing them to her in great glee, his mother's disappointment and scolding, which ends in Jack being sent supperless to bed, and the mother throwing the beans in the garden in great anger. Scene 3 -- Growing of the Beanstalk. A night scene in the garden, with beautiful moonlight and cloud effects. The good fairy appears, and waving her magic wand, commands the beanstalk to grow; and, lo and behold, from the hatful of beans that has been so ruthlessly thrown into the garden, a beanstalk of great size is seen to grow in a few moments, and to climb up the cliff above the clouds. Scene 4 -- Jack's Dream. Showing the interior of Jack's bedroom, with the moonlight streaming through the window. The good fairy appears and stands beside Jack's cot directing his dream. Jack dreams of the growing beanstalk and the award that awaits him who dares to climb it. Next he sees a vision of the Horn of Plenty, bags of the giant's gold and the talking harp, which dances before him in a weird manner. One by one these articles appear and disappear in the picture, coming as if from the dim distance, and as quickly and silently fading away. The climax of this scene is reached when the hen which lays the golden eggs walks into Jack's chamber. An egg is left on the floor, which suddenly grows to an enormous size, breaks in two, and there appears in its centre Jack's little fairy, who is afterward to make him happy for life. Scene 5 -- Climbing the Beanstalk. Jack awakens in the early morning, and looking out from his window, finds the enormous beanstalk which has grown above the clouds. Remembering his dream of the night before, he believes he can climb it with ease; but also remembering his mother's scolding for trading the cow for the beans, he is prompted to be cautious, and concludes to consult his mother. She protests vigorously against his climbing the beanstalk, but Jack sending her into the house on a pretext, starts up the beanstalk without her knowledge. The mother returns and is frantic when she finds Jack has gone up beyond her reach. She scolds and commands him to return, but the dauntless boy only laughs and continues to climb. His playmates, who are calling for Jack on their way to school, witness Jack's start on his perilous journey, and joining hands, they dance about the beanstalk in great numbers, cheering and waving their hats at the brave boy. [end of part 1] Scene 6 -- Jack Above the Clouds. Here we dissolve the view and show Jack two- thirds up the beanstalk, far above the clouds, with his mother's cottage and the hilltops a great distance below him. He is still tirelessly climbing his ladder of bean vines, and pauses as he reaches a dizzy height to wave his hat to his playmates and mother. Scene 7 -- Arrival at the Top of the Beanstalk. Jack arrives at the top of the beanstalk in what appears to be a fairyland. He is very tired and sleepy and lays down in a bed of moss to rest. He soon falls asleep, and his good fairy again appears and tells Jack the story of the giant, who, many years ago, killed and robbed his father (who was a knight residing in a castle), and drove his mother from their home. She then causes a vision of the giant's castle to appear before Jack, and commands him to go to the giant's house where great fortunes await him. Jack's enthusiasm is fired by the story of his father's wrongs, and he immediately sets out to obey the commands of the fairy. Scene 8 --The Giant's Kitchen. Shows Jack's arrival at the giant's house, and being admitted to the kitchen by the giant's wife. The giant suddenly enters, and in great fear lest he kill and eat the little boy, the good wife hides Jack in a large kettle. The giant comes in and roughly demands his supper, then his harp, bags of gold and the hen which lays the golden eggs. He finally falls asleep from the playing of the harp. Jack creeps from his hiding place in the kettle and steals the hen and as many of the bags of gold as he can carry away. Just as he leaves the kitchen door the giant awakens, and, seizing his great cudgel, chases our little hero, who is now thoroughly frightened. [end of part 2] Scene 9 -- Jack Descending the Beanstalk and Death of the Giant. The chase to the beanstalk has been very close, but Jack reaches it a little ahead of the giant. He throws the bags of gold down into his mother's garden and quickly scrambles down with the precious hen hanging over his shoulder. Reaching the ground first, he hastily commands his mother to bring him the ax, and vigorously chops at the beanstalk until it falls in a heap, bringing the giant to the ground with a mighty crash, breaking his neck and instantly killing him. Here the good fairy again appears and informs Jack that he has acted like a brave knight's son and that he deserves to have his inheritance restored to him. She waves her magic wand, and, lo! Jack's costume is changed from that of a peasant boy to a young knight, and his mother is likewise transformed from a peasant woman to a lady. Closing Tableau. A most beautiful scene, showing Jack and his mother seated in the fairy's boat, which is drawn by three beautiful swans, proceeding on their way to the castle which is to be their future home. The good fairy is seen to be flying through the air, guiding Jack and his mother on their way. In introducing this novel tableau, giving as it were an entirely new version to the ending of the story, we believe we are adding a feature which will be most pleasing to every child who witnesses the performance.... Note -- In this beautiful production, in changing from one scene to the other, transformations are made by beautiful dissolving and fading effects. There are no sudden jumps whatever, and the entire effect is at once pleasing, gratifying and comprehensive, and the audience finds itself following with ease the thread of this most wonderful of all fairy tales....

        "description": "The Extra Girl is a 1923 American silent comedy film directed by F. Richard Jones and starring Mabel Normand. Produced by Mack Sennett, The Extra Girl followed earlier films about the film industry and also paved the way for later films about Hollywood, such as King Vidor\u2019s Show People (1928). It was still unusual in 1923 for filmmakers to make a film about the southern California film industry, then little more than ten years old. Still, many of the Hollywood clich\u00e9s of small town girls travelling to Hollywood to become film stars are here to reinforce the myths of Tinseltown.\nSue Graham (Normand) is a small town girl who travels to Hollywood to escape marriage, and in the hope of becoming a motion picture star. She wins a contract with a studio on the strength of a picture of a quite different (and very attractive) girl sent instead of hers; but when she arrives the mistake is discovered. Since the error was the result of another\u2019s deception, the studio manager agrees to give her a job in the costume department. She eventually gets the opportunity to screen test, but it turns out disastrously \u2013 although in a nod to the actress behind the character the director calls her \"a natural comedian.\" Sue's parents come out to California, and invest money with a shifty individual who swindles them out of their life savings. Sue and childhood friend Dave, who has also followed her, retrieve the money. Despite the unsuccessful film career, all turns out well.\nCast\nMabel Normand as Sue Graham\nGeorge Nichols as Zachariah \"Pa\" Graham\nAnna Dodge as Mary \"Ma\" Graham (credited as Anna Hernandez)\nRalph Graves as Dave Giddings\nVernon Dent as Aaron Applejohn\nRamsey Wallace as T. Phillip Hackett\nCharlotte Mineau as Belle \"Widow\" Brown\nMary Mason as Actress\nMax Davidson as Tailor\nLouise Carver as Madame McCarthy, Wardrobe Mistress\nCarl Stockdale as Director\nHarry Gribbon as Comedy Director\nGeorge Beranger as Actor in Wardrobe Line (credited as Andr\u00e9 Beranger)\nTeddy the Dog as Teddy\nBilly Armstrong as Comedian in Derby (uncredited)\nDuke the Dog as Duke (uncredited)\nRobert Dudley as Financier (uncredited)\nCharles K. French as Studio Manager (uncredited)\nNuma the Lion as Numa (uncredited)\nJackie Lucas as Son (uncredited)\nEric Mayne as Lion Film Director (uncredited)\nElsie Tarron as Actress (uncredited)\nActors Billy Bevan and William Desmond appear as themselves. Producer Mack Sennett can be glimpsed briefly as a straw-hatted onlooker at Sue's screen test.\nProduction\nDirected by F. Richard Jones, the film features several shots of semi-rural Southern California (the Edendale area along present-day Glendale Boulevard, where Sennett's studio was located) showing houses and streets of the early 1920s, and of a Hollywood studio in action. One shot in particular, a high-angle view, shows a film set, with actors, two cameras and operators, several production people, and a mood orchestra composed of a pianist and violinist, to set the proper mood for the actors. Another shows an open stage with crew scrambling up scaffolding to the sunlight diffusing panels above.\nThe Extra Girl was Normand's final feature film and her last film working with producer Sennett.",

Society members start dropping like flies. Sherlock Holmes is approached by member James Murphy's widow, who is miffed at being left penniless by her husband. When Captain Pyke is shot, Holmes keys in on his mysterious Chinese widow as well as the shady Merrydew. Other members keep dying--Malcom Dearing first, then Mr. Baker. There is also an attempt on the life of young Eileen Forrester, who became a reluctant society member upon the death of her father. Holmes' uncanny observations and insights are put to the test.\nThe failure of the original copyright holder to renew the film's copyright resulted in it falling into public domain, meaning that virtually anyone could duplicate and sell a VHS/DVD copy of the film.

Green, starring Colleen Moore, produced by her husband John McCormick (1893-1961), and co-starring Moore's most popular co-star, Lloyd Hughes. The film is based on the syndicated comic strip of the same name by William M. Conselman and Charles Plumb.\nIn 2013, Ella Cinders was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot\nIn the house of late father, Ella Cinders (Colleen Moore) works for her stepmother and two stepsisters, Prissy Pill (Emily Gerdes) and Lotta Pill (Doris Baker), finding support from the local iceman, Waite Lifter (Lloyd Hughes). The Gem Film Company has a contest in which the winner gets an all-expense paid trip to Hollywood and a film role. A photograph is needed to enter, so Ella spends three nights babysitting to raise $3 for the photo session.\nHowever, the photographer unwittingly takes a picture of her looking cross-eyed at a fly on her nose which turns out to be the photo entered in the contest. Entrants must go to a Town Hall ball, but Ella's stepmother and stepsisters won't allow her to go. Waite sees her crying on the front steps and tells her he will take her to the ball. She says she has nothing to wear, so he convinces her to use one of her stepsisters' dresses. At the judges' table, her stepsisters react violently when they see the dress. The embarrassed Ella flees the ball, losing one of her slippers.\nLater, the judges come to the house and tell Ella that she is the winner because they were amused by the cross-eyed photo. Ella heads for Hollywood, where she is disappointed to discover the contest was a fraud. She nevertheless manages to land a movie contract. Waite turns out to be football hero George Waite, and the two are reunited.\nCast\nColleen Moore - Ella Cinders\nLloyd Hughes - Waite Lifter\nVera Lewis - Ma Cinders\nDoris Baker - Lotta Pill\nEmily Gerdes - Prissy Pill\nMike Donlin - Film Studio Gateman\nJed Prouty - Mayor\nJack Duffy - Fire Chief\nHarry Allen - Photographer\nAlfred E.

He is on a train going to visit Verbena Singlefoot, a sturdy widow with whom he has been corresponding. She owns her building a takes in boarders. She won a beauty prize in the Chicago World Fair of 1893 (22 years previously).\nHe puts on his overcoat to get off the train but two men are trying to put on the same coat. He opens the carriage window and sees Verbena outside, he leans out to hug her then passes his bags out of the window and exits there instead of the door. They marry and head home. The ex-husband loiters at the entrance.\nHe is introduced to her son - a bratty young teenager dressed as a cowboy - who demands that Cyril dances the \"bagpipe\" (meaning hornpipe). He fires his guns at Cyril's feet to make him dance. When the boy seems to lose interest and wanders off he goes to check and gets his cap shot off.\nHe is then introduced to his new daughter, Smyrna, a precocious girl of around 16.

Smyrna asks \"did he hurt you Daddy?\" and Cyril asks Verbena for an explanation.\nOn their wedding night he puts on his nightgown and nightcap. He hides in the bed and does not realise that it is the ex-husband getting in, not Verbena. They fight over the covers before Cyril spots his mistake. Verbena comes in and checks his pockets for money. She cries when he says he has none. The ex-husband tells him he will have to work to pay him his alimony. He dreams of wrestling him then they actually wrestle..

The Immigrant (also called Broke) starring the Charlie Chaplin Tramp character as an immigrant coming to the United States who is accused of theft on the voyage across the Atlantic Ocean, and befriends a young woman along the way. It also stars Edna Purviance and Eric Campbell. The movie was written and directed by Chaplin. According to Kevin Brownlow and David Gill's documentary series Unknown Chaplin, the first scenes to be written and filmed take place in what became the movie's second half, in which the penniless Tramp finds a coin and goes for a meal in a restaurant, not realising that the coin has fallen out of his pocket. It was not until later that Chaplin decided the reason the Tramp was penniless was that he had just arrived on a boat from Europe, and used this notion as the basis for the first half. Purviance reportedly was required to eat so many plates of beans during the many takes to complete the restaurant sequence (in character as another immigrant who falls in love with Charlie) that she became physically ill. The scene in which Chaplin's character kicks an immigration officer was cited later as evidence of his anti-Americanism when he was forced to leave the United States in the 1950s. The film has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0008133/",

But the court of public opinion is still against him, and the medical board is meeting to decide whether or not to take his medical license away from him. Before they do, Cromwell, an amateur pilot, decides to join his friend, WWI Ace Donald Evans, on a flight to Alaska looking for a shorter route to Japan by following the Aleutian Islands. They crash in Alaska and Evans is killed, but Cromwell is rescued by a fur trapper named Tom Ross. He takes Cromwell to Armstrong's Trading Post, where is is nursed back to health by Klondike, a girl who works for Armstrong, and was engaged to marry Armstrong's son Jim. The latter is suffering from the same disease that Cromwell's last patient had. Mark talks Cromwell into performing the same operation again and, this time, it is a success.

        "date": "1925",
        "subject": null,
        "description": "Don Q, Son of Zorro is a 1925 American silent romantic adventure film that is sequel to the 1920 silent film The Mark of Zorro. It was loosely based upon the 1909 novel Don Q.'s Love Story, written by the mother-and-son duo Kate and Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard. The story was reworked in 1925 (after Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard's death) into a vehicle for the Johnston McCulley character Zorro. \nThe film was well-received: the New York Times rated it one of its top ten movies of 1925.\nPlot\nDon Diego de la Vega (Zorro)'s son, Cesar (Douglas Fairbanks), is in Spain finishing his education. While Cesar is showing off to friends his remarkable prowess with the whip, he accidentally clips off the feather shako on the hat of Don Sebastian (Donald Crisp) of the Palace Guard. Although Cesar apologizes immediately, Sebastian is unforgiving. Their duel is interrupted by a runaway bull. Trapped on the ground with his sword belt tangled in his boot, certain to be gored by the bull, Sebastian is saved at the last minute by Cesar. This further infuriates him. The action is observed by Queen Isabella (Stella De Lanti) and her guest, Austrian Archduke Paul (Warner Oland); she requests Cesar's company immediately. Another friend of Cesar, Don Fabrique Borusta (Jean Hersholt), offers to bring him to Her Majesty.\nMeanwhile, Cesar encounters Dolores (Mary Astor), daughter of his father's old friend, General de Muro (Jack McDonald), as she poses for a sculptor. It is love at first sight. But Sebastian, who comes from a poor family, has set his sights on Dolores and her family's wealth, and is determined to win her. Later, the Archduke invites Cesar to paint the town, with Sebastian as their \"duenna.\" In a local tavern the Archduke offends the patrons, all seeming ruffians, by flirting with the dancer. Sebastian contrives his and the Duke's escape, but locks Cesar in the tavern to defend himself against the cutthroats. In the carriage that takes them away from what he is sure will be Cesar's death, Sebastian declares he has a meeting with Dolores. The Archduke invites himself along. While Sebastian asks the General for his daughter's hand, the Archduke sees Dolores serenaded by Cesar, who escaped (easily) and even acquired a guitar as a souvenir. Seeing the reactions of the young couple, the Archduke knows Cesar has won Dolores's heart.\nAlthough penniless, Don Fabrique has designs on succeeding in society. He glues together a discarded invitation to the Archduke\u2019s Grand Ball, and crashes the party. At the ball, Cesar and Sebastian sit on either side of Dolores, both seeming frustrated in their efforts to woo her. The Archduke summons her to him. When Cesar sees the Archduke caress Dolores's cheek, Cesar becomes jealous and goes to confront him. But the Archduke assures him that he is working in Cesar's favor, and proves it by dragging Sebastian to another room to play cards while Cesar and Dolores dance together. Cesar pulls Dolores to a balcony for ardent lovemaking. Fabrique sees them; when the pair are interrupted by Dolores\u2019s father, General de Muro, who recognizes Cesar and is ready to give his blessing, Fabrique believes they are about to be betrothed.\nIn the card room, the Archduke declares that Sebastian is as unlucky at cards as he is in love. Franque tiptoes in, and tells the Archduke that he saw Cesar and Dolores kissing: surely they will be married now. The Archduke summons Cesar to congratulate him, to the horror of Sebastian. When he enters, Cesar is offended at the impropriety of this news, and learns that the source was Fabrique. Such bad manners should not go unpunished. He informs the Archduke that someone here doesn't belong, and asks if he should remove him. Archduke Paul nods, and Cesar pulls Fabrique out of the room by tugging his nose.\nThe Archduke continues to taunt Sebastian, a foolish move when Sebastian, enraged by jealousy, pulls his sword and stabs the Archduke before he realizes what he has done. He hides when Cesar, hearing something, enters, then strikes Cesar unconscious. He frames him for the Archduke's murder, then casually leaves. With his last dying energy, the Archduke pulls a playing card off the table and writes on it: Sebastian assassinated me. Archduke Paul.\nFabrique enters, finds Cesar unconscious, finds the playing card and, miffed at Cesar's insult, takes it. Shortly thereafter he confronts Sebastian with his demands: to be appointed Civil Governor. Both stand by while the Guard arrests Cesar for the murder and orders his immediate execution to prevent an international incident. But General de Muro offers Cesar a gentleman\u2019s way out by giving him a dagger. Cesar pretends to stab himself and falls to the moat below the castle.\nMonths pass, while Cesar hides in the ruins of the old family castle. He pretends to be Don Q, for \"a trick must be answered by a trick!\" Fabrique has become Civil Governor, receiving regular pay-offs from Sebastian. Fabrique has even taken over Carlo's servants, and maidservant Lola (Lottie Pickford), seeing how Sebastian behaves around Fabrique, runs to tell Cesar that although gossip says they are close friends, in truth Sebastian is afraid of Fabrique. This will prove the leverage Cesar needs to establish his innocence.\nAfter months of mourning over Cesar, Dolores is pushed to marry Sebastian. Just as she is about to sign the marriage contract with Sebastian, Cesar appears at the window. He is alive! The Queen orders Cesar\u2019s arrest. The best man to find him: that one-eyed ferret, Colonel Matsado (Albert MacQuarrie). But when Matsado stops at a country inn on his way into the city, Cesar waylays him, steals his uniform, and impersonates him. Back in the city Cesar as Matsado pretends to beat his (now Fabrique's) old manservant Robledo (Charles Stevens) for information on Cesar's whereabouts, then convinces Fabrique to accompany him to the ruins where Cesar has been living these past months. There he is determined to find what hold Fabrique has on Sebastian.\nIn a whirlwind finish, Sebastian and the real Matsado track Cesar to his lair, as do his father, Zorro (Fairbanks), who with the mute faithful family servant Bernardo (Tote Du Crow), has sailed from California to Spain to help. On the way to the ruins they pass Dolores and her mother along the same road. Finally, as all gather at the ruins, Zorro and Don Q battle the soldiers, Fabrique confesses, Sebastian is beaten, de Muro recognizes his old friend, the villains are arrested, and Cesar and Dolores reunited.\nCast\nDouglas Fairbanks as Don Cesar de Vega / Zorro\nMary Astor as Dolores de Muro\nJack McDonald as Gen. de Muro\nDonald Crisp as Don Sebastian\nStella De Lanti as the Queen\nWarner Oland as The Archduke\nJean Hersholt as Don Fabrique Borusta\nAlbert MacQuarrie as Colonel Maatsado\nLottie Pickford as Lola (credited Lottie Pickford Forrest)\nCharles Stevens as Robledo\nTote Du Crow as Bernardo\nMartha Franklin as The Duenna\nJuliette Belanger as The Danger\nRoy Coulson as Dancer's Admirer\nEnrique Acosta as Ramon",

The second features Hubby grudgingly taking the family en masse out on his brand new Butterfly Six automobile, and the third is an escapade with his sleepwalking mother-in-law. The third segment almost qualifies the film as a horror movie, as in it, Hubby mistakenly believes he has killed his mother-in-law, and when she starts sleepwalking later, he thinks she's a ghost haunting him.\nCast\nHarold Lloyd as Hubby\nJobyna Ralston as Wifey\nJosephine Crowell as Her Mother, Winnifred Ward Stokes\nCharles Stevenson as Her Big Brother, Charley Stokes\nMickey McBan as Her Little Brother, Bobby Stokes\nEvelyn Burns as Bit Part (uncredited)\nAndy De Villa as Glen Reed (uncredited)\nEdgar Dearing as Motorcycle Cop (uncredited)\nPat Harmon as Bus Straphanger in Spider Gag (uncredited)\nFred Holmes as Man (uncredited)\nBilly Rinaldi as Brunette Boy on Trolley (uncredited)\nGeorge Ward as Blonde Boy on Trolley (uncredited)\nS.D.

        "description": "He Who Gets Slapped is a 1924 American silent psychological thriller film starring Lon Chaney, Norma Shearer, and John Gilbert, and directed by Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m. The film is based on the Russian play \u0422\u043e\u0442, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0449\u0451\u0447\u0438\u043d\u044b (\"He Who Gets Slapped\", transliterated as Tot, kto polu\u010d\u00e1jet po\u0161\u010d\u00f3\u010diny) by playwright Leonid Andreyev, which was published in 1914 and in English, as He Who Gets Slapped, in 1922. The Russian original was made into a Russian movie in 1916.\nHe Who Gets Slapped was the first film produced entirely by the newly formed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It was not, however, MGM's first released movie, as the film was held until the Christmas season when higher attendance was expected. The movie was highly profitable and critically hailed. It was also the first film to feature Leo the Lion as the mascot for MGM. Previously, Leo appeared in the logo for Goldwyn Pictures Corporation in 1916, and the trademark was retained by MGM when the companies merged.\nThe film was important in the careers of Chaney, Shearer, Gilbert, and Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m. In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film entered the public domain on January 1, 2020 (along with all American films from 1924) as dictated by U.S. copyright law.\nPlot\nPaul Beaumont (Lon Chaney) is a scientist who labored for years alone to prove his radical theories on the origin of mankind. Baron Regnard (Marc McDermott) becomes his patron, enabling him to do research while living in his mansion. One day, Beaumont announces to his beloved wife Marie and the Baron that he has proved all his theories and is ready to present them before the Academy of the Sciences. He leaves the arrangements to the Baron. However, after Beaumont goes to sleep, Marie steals his key, opens the safe containing his papers, and gives them to the Baron.\nOn the appointed day, Paul travels to the Academy with the Baron. He is aghast when the Baron, instead of introducing him, takes credit for Paul's work himself. After he recovers from the shock, Paul confronts him in front of everyone, but the Baron tells them that Paul is merely his assistant and slaps him. All of the academicians laugh at his humiliation. Paul later seeks comfort from his wife, but she brazenly admits she and the Baron are having an affair and calls him a clown. Paul leaves them.\nFive years pass by. Paul is now a clown calling himself \"HE who gets slapped\", the star attraction of a small circus near Paris. His act consists of his getting slapped every evening by other clowns, and includes Paul pretending to present in front of the Academy of the Sciences.\nAnother of the performers is Bezano (John Gilbert), a daredevil horseback rider. Consuelo (Norma Shearer), the daughter of the impoverished Count Mancini, applies to join his act. Bezano falls in love with Consuelo, as does Paul. Consuelo's father, however, is planning to restore the family's fortunes by marrying her to the wealthy Baron Regnard.\nOne night, during HE's performance, he spots the Baron in the audience and becomes enraged. The Baron then goes backstage and begins flirting with Consuelo, which she does not like. The next day, the Baron sends Consuelo jewelry, but she rejects it.\nWhen her father leaves for a meeting with the Baron, Bezano takes Consuelo out to the countryside for a romantic meeting, where they declare their love for each other. Meanwhile, Count Mancini convinces the reluctant Baron that the only way he can have Consuelo is by marrying her. The Baron agrees, and discards the heartbroken Marie, leaving her with a check.\nLater, HE admits to Consuelo he, too, is in love with her. She thinks he is kidding and laughingly slaps him. They are interrupted by the Baron and the Count, who inform Consuelo she will marry the Baron after the evening performance. When HE tries to interfere, he is locked in an adjoining room, where an angry lion is kept in a cage. He moves the cage so that, when he carefully opens it, only the door to the next room prevents the lion from escaping. HE re-enters the other room through the only other entrance (making sure to lock it behind him) and reveals his identity to the Baron. HE threatens the Baron, but the Count stabs him with a sword.\nThe Baron and the Count try to leave but, finding the main entrance locked, open the side door, releasing the lion. The animal kills the Count, then the Baron. However, the lion tamer shows up and saves HE from the same fate. HE goes on stage and collapses. He assures Consuelo he is happy and that she will be happy, before dying in her arms.\nCast\nLon Chaney as Paul Beaumont, aka HE\nNorma Shearer as Consuelo\nJohn Gilbert as Bezano\nTully Marshall as Count Mancini\nMarc McDermott as Baron Regnard\nFord Sterling as Tricaud",

It is based on a short story by Arthur Stringer and stars Richard Dix and Esther Ralston.\nPlot\nBill Dana (Richard Dix) meets Mollie (Esther Ralston) in the park and is smitten. Mollie expresses admiration for the rugged men of the west, and Bill decides to go to his Uncle Lester's (Edmund Breese) ranch to man up and deserve Mollie's love. Upon arrival he finds that the west isn't quite so wild anymore, with cowboys herding cows in cars and his uncle spending a lot of time on the golf course. Bill settles in to enjoy his stay, but after a while Mollie announces she is coming for a visit. Bill and Uncle Lester cook up a plan to pass as rugged for a day or so, forcing the cowboys onto horses and dressing the servants up as Native Americans, and Mollie is fooled. When she decides to stay longer, Bill puts on a show of being too rugged. He eats with atrocious table manners and picks a fight with a farmhand. Mollie decides she preferred him un-rugged.\nA print of Womanhandled is held at the Library of Congress.\nCast\nRichard Dix as Bill Dana\nEsther Ralston as Mollie\nEdmund Breese as Uncle Lester\nCora Williams as Aunt Abby\nOlive Tell as Gwen\nMargaret Morris as Iris Vale\nTammany Young as Spike\nEli Nadel as The Kid\nBasset Blakely as Cow Hand\nEdgar Nelson Pinky (uncredited)\nIvan Simpson as Butler (uncredited)",

Fields would later star in a second film version, Poppy (1936).\nPlot\nBecause she married a circus performer, Judge Foster (Erville Alderson) casts out his only daughter. Just before her death a few years later, she leaves her little girl Sally (Carol Dempster) in the care of her friend McGargle (W.C. Fields), a good-natured crook, juggler and fakir. Sally grows up in this atmosphere and is unaware of her parentage. McGargle, realizing his responsibility to the child, gets a job with a carnival company playing at Great Meadows, where the Fosters live. A real estate boom has made them wealthy. Sally is a hit with her dancing. Peyton (Alfred Lunt), the son of Judge Foster's friend, falls in love with Sally. To save him, the Judge arranges to have McGargle and Sally arrested. McGargle escapes, but Sally is hunted down and brought back. McGargle, hearing of Sally's plight, steals a Flivver, and after many delays, reaches the courtroom and presents proof of Sally's parentage. The Judge dismisses the case and his wife takes Sally in her arms, but Peyton's claim is stronger and she agrees to become his wife. McGargle is persuaded to remain and is found an outlet for his peculiar talents in selling real estate.\nCast\nCarol Dempster as Sally\nW. C.

        "description": "Go West is an American silent movie starring Buster Keaton.\nKeaton portrays Friendless, who travels west to try to make his fortune. Once there, he tries his hand at bronco-busting, cattle wrangling and dairy farming, eventually forming a bond with a cow named \"Brown Eyes.\" Eventually he finds himself leading a herd of cattle through Los Angeles.\nPlot\nA drifter identified only as \"Friendless\" (Keaton) sells the last of his possessions, keeping only a few trinkets and a picture of his mother. The money buys him only some bread and a sausage then is gone.\nUnable to find a job in the city, he stows away on a train. He thinks it is going to New York but it is heading west. He sleeps in a barrel but the barrel rolls of the train. He manages to get a job at a cattle ranch despite having no experience. Meanwhile, a neglected cow named Brown Eyes fails to give milk and is sent out to the field along with the other cattle intended for slaughter.\nAs Friendless tries to figure out how to milk a cow, he's told to go out and help the other ranch hands bring in the cattle. Unsuccessful in riding a horse, he falls off and sees Brown Eyes. Noticing her limp, Friendless examines her hoof and removes the rock that had been hurting her. Brown Eyes proceeds to follow Friendless around, saving him from a bull attack. Realizing that he's finally found a companion, Friendless strikes up a friendship with the cow, giving her his blanket at night and attempting to protect her from wild dogs. The next day, Brown Eyes follows Friendless everywhere, much to the chagrin of the other ranch hands. Friendless accidentally sets two steers loose after they'd been corralled in, but on the joking suggestion of the other hands, brings them back in by waving his red bandanna.\nThe ranch owner (Truesdale) and his daughter (Myers) are preparing to sell the cattle to a stockyard, though another rancher wants to hold out for a higher price. The owner, no longer wanting to wait, prepares to ship the whole herd out. Friendless, shocked to hear that Brown Eyes will go to a slaughterhouse, refuses to let her go. The ranch owner fires him and gives him his wages. Friendless tries to buy his friend back with his earnings, but is told that it's not enough. After failing to get more money from a card game, he joins Brown Eyes in the cattle car and tries to find a way to free her. The train is ambushed by the other rancher and his men. Friendless and the ranch owner's other hands manage to drive off the attackers, but only Friendless makes it back to the train as the others chase away the rancher.\nArriving in Los Angeles, Friendless frees Brown Eyes and leads her away, using his red bandana once more to guide the other thousand steers to the stockyard. The townspeople are terrified of the cattle as some of the cows break away and begin entering the stores, but Friendless manages to corral them together. Friendless ties Brown Eyes up before going back to retrieve the other cattle, leaving his red bandana with her in order to keep her cool. Realizing his mistake, he enters a masquerade store to find something red to attract the cows. Deciding on a red devil's outfit, he exits the store and the cattle begin to chase him. The police attempt to arrest him, but are mistakenly sprayed with hoses from the fire department, who flee once they see the cattle coming.\nThe ranch owner, realizing his ruin if the cattle are not sold, drives with his daughter to the stockyard. The owner tells him that no cattle have arrived yet. Defeated, the ranch owner prepares to leave when he sees Friendless leading the herd into the stockyard. Overjoyed, the ranch owner tells Friendless that his house and anything he owns is his to ask for. Friendless says that he only wants \"her,\" gesturing behind him to where the ranch owner's daughter is. The owner is surprised and the daughter flattered, but they quickly realize that it's Brown Eyes that he's referring to. The three drive back to the ranch, with Brown Eyes beside Friendless in the back seat.\nCast\nBuster Keaton - Friendless\nHoward Truesdale - Ranch owner\nKathleen Myers - Ranch owner's daughter\nRay Thompson - Ranch foreman\nBrown Eyes - The Cow 'Brown Eyes'\nRoscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle - Woman in department store (uncredited)\nJoe Keaton - Man in Barber Shop (uncredited)\nGus Leonard - General store owner (uncredited)\nBabe London - Woman in department store (uncredited)",

It features Kathryn McGuire, Joe Keaton, and Ward Crane.\nIn 1991, Sherlock Jr. was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" In 2000, the American Film Institute, as part of its AFI 100 Years... series, ranked the film #62 in its list of the funniest films of all time (AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs).\nPlot\nA movie theater projectionist and janitor is in love with a beautiful loveable girl. However, he has a rival, the \"local sheik\". Neither has much money. The projectionist buys a $1 box of chocolates, all he can afford, and changes the price to $4 before giving it and a ring to her. The sheik steals and pawns the girl's father's pocket watch for $4. With the money, he buys a $3 box of chocolates for the girl. When the father notices his watch is missing, the sheik slips the pawn ticket into the projectionist's pocket unnoticed. The projectionist, studying to be a detective, offers to solve the crime, but when the pawn ticket is found in his pocket, he is banished from the girl's home.\nWhile showing a film about the theft of a pearl necklace, the projectionist falls asleep and dreams that he enters the movie as a detective, Sherlock Jr. The other actors are replaced by the projectionist's \"real\" acquaintances. The dream begins with the theft being committed by the villain with the aid of the butler. The girl's father calls for the world's greatest detective, and Sherlock Jr. arrives. Fearing that they will be caught, the villain and the butler attempt to kill Sherlock through several traps, poison, and an elaborate pool game with an exploding 13 ball. When these fail, the villain and butler try to escape. Sherlock Jr. tracks them down to a warehouse but is outnumbered by the gang to which the villain was selling the necklace. During the confrontation, Sherlock discovers that they have kidnapped the girl. With the help of his assistant, Gillette, Sherlock Jr. manages to save the girl, and defeat the gang.\nWhen he awakens, the girl shows up to tell him that she and her father learned the identity of the real thief after she went to the pawn shop to see who actually pawned the pocket watch. As a reconciliation scene happens to be playing on the screen, the projectionist mimics the actor's romantic behavior.\nCast\nBuster Keaton as Projectionist / Sherlock Jr. \u2013 A poor, young projectionist that wants to marry The Girl. He has an interest in being a detective and when he falls asleep, he dreams of being Sherlock Jr., the world's greatest detective.\nKathryn McGuire as The Girl \u2013 The daughter of a fairly wealthy man, whom the Projectionist is in love with.

        "description": "The Red Kimono (spelled as \"The Red Kimona\" in the opening credits) is a 1925 American silent drama film about prostitution produced by Dorothy Davenport (billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid) and starring Priscilla Bonner. This is the debut film of Director Walter Lang.\nThe title comes from a red-colored dress shown through the film, meant to symbolize the main character's occupation as a \"scarlet woman\" (a prostitute).\nPlot\nA woman, Gabrielle Darley, shoots a man, Howard Blaine, in the back as he is buying a wedding ring, then asks pardon and expresses love to his corpse as she waits for arrest. In her jail cell, she is supported by a kind matron. At her trial, she is asked to explain how she came to shoot Blaine, and she narrates her story. Blaine courted her and claimed he would marry her, and she left her unloving family to go with him to New Orleans. There, Blaine did not marry her but only took her to a house in a sleazy neighbourhood; in a bedroom there, a mirror vision of herself in bridal attire gave way to a vision of herself in a red dress (strikingly hand-coloured in the film), indicating that she knew she was entering on a life of prostitution. She gave in for love of Blaine, and spent several miserable years servicing men he sent in to her, spurred on by little love notes from him.\nThe mocking prosecutor suggests that she shot Blaine out of jealousy because he was going to marry another woman, and she acknowledges this and points out that he was buying the ring with money she earned for him. Women in the courtroom cry. Despite the prosecutor's finger-wagging and the judge's frivolous boredom, the all-male jury deems her not guilty.\nGabrielle tells the kind matron that she would now like to redeem herself by working to help people, and drops her brilliant red dress on the floor as a sign that she will never go back to that work. Beverly Fontaine, a society matron fond of getting publicity by taking up reformed criminals, invites her to come live at her house. There, she meets the nice chauffeur Terrance O'Day, but is put on display at parties for Beverly's friends and tormented by tactless questions about her prostitution work. Terrance takes her on a sweet, wholesome date to an amusement park, and she realizes that there is a good kind of man she has never encountered before.\nBeverly gets tired of her and goes on a trip, with Terrance driving her, leaving Gabrielle a letter to the superintendent of a local hospital about training as a nurse. The superintendent, however, recognizes her and throws her out. She is unable to get work, losing her job as a maid when she gets upset at seeing her defense attorney's wife wearing her ring she had to give him as her fee. Starving and desperate, she telegraphs to Clara, a supportive friend in the New Orleans brothel, to send her the train fare to return there and take up her old profession. Clara does.\nThe telegraph operator is a friend of Terrance's, and goes to Beverly Fontaine's house to tell him of this just as she and Terrance return from her trip. Terrance throws up his job and commandeers Beverly's car to drive to the train station to stop Gabrielle, but is five minutes too late. He gets on the next train, and, in New Orleans, takes a taxi to the address on the telegram. Meanwhile, Gabrielle, hesitating on the doorstep of the brothel, is attacked by a brute, and is hit by a car as she runs from him. Terrance sees the accident, but does not realize it is she. Hearing from Clara that she has not shown up yet, he hangs around the street looking for her for days.\nGabrielle is recovering in the hospital when she overhears staff people saying that, because the U.S. has just entered World War I and the flu pandemic has started, they are in desperate need of additional nurses and helpers. She offers herself, and is hired. She is scrubbing the hospital floor when Terrance enters in uniform, having enlisted and serving as an ambulance driver. They are reunited, and he asks her to marry him before he goes overseas. She declares her love but postpones their marriage till he comes back and she has worked longer and become worthy of a happy life with him.\nA woman who has been keeping an album of clippings about Gabrielle, who seems to be Beverly's maid, tells us that this happy life was attained for these two. But Gabrielle is only one of many women in this terrible situation, she says, and it is up to all women to help their unfortunate sisters.\nCast\nPriscilla Bonner as Gabrielle Darley\nNellie Bly Baker as Clara Johnson, Gabrielle's neighbor\nCarl Miller as Howard Blaine\nMary Carr as Prison Matron\nVirginia Pearson as Mrs. Beverly Fontaine\nTyrone Power, Sr. as Gabrielle's father\nSheldon Lewis as District Attorney\nTheodore von Eltz as Terrance O'Day or, Freddy Fred the Chauffeur\nEmily Fitzroy as The Housekeeper\nGeorge Siegmann as Mr. Mack, A Client\nDot Farley as Inquisitive Woman\nMax Asher as H.E.

        "description": "Manhattan Tower 1932 This is a partially restored version of a public domain movie Manhattan Tower, an entertaining depression era film. The movie has several intertwined stories about some workers in this office building. Manhattan tower is a movie which has many modern resonances in the twenty first century. The theme of crooked businessmen, industrial failures, and common people being cheated is familiar and all too real after the Enron affair. It has a heart warming romance, some comedy, and many good shots of the Empire State building which inspired this tale. The movie was made the year after the Empire State building was opened. For nearly half a century it was the worlds tallest building, and is probably the most famous. I have included a complete cast list so you can watch for some well known actors such as Walter Brennan in character parts. There are other familiar faces in small parts that are not identified. The original was a VHS tape made from a fair 16mm copy of the movie. This copy is fairly complete and only about 1\u00bd minutes seem to be missing. The video was slightly sharpened and the audio track was much improved by noise reduction, equalization, and tick/pop removal. The video jitter was partially reduced, and many defects were removed either by software or by hand. Unfortunately the available consumer software could not automatically remove the VHS/poor transfer wobble, or totally remove the video spots. Only some of the worst defects were removed by hand. The use of automatic video brightness control washed out details and caused brightness changes that could not be easily compensated. In addition the original copy was badly framed which cut off part of the picture. This version can play without any judder because it has been detelecined back to the original 24fps. This is probably the most watchable and listenable copy available of this movie until a better copy is made from a good print. 2012-12-22 The original upload had a bad goof where a section of the movie was duplicated and overlayed over a later section. It has been fixed and updated.

        "description": "The Red Kimono (spelled as \"The Red Kimona\" in the opening credits) is a 1925 American silent drama film about prostitution produced by Dorothy Davenport (billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid) and starring Priscilla Bonner. This is the debut film of Director Walter Lang.\nThe title comes from a red-colored dress shown through the film, meant to symbolize the main character's occupation as a \"scarlet woman\" (a prostitute).\nPlot\nA woman, Gabrielle Darley, shoots a man, Howard Blaine, in the back as he is buying a wedding ring, then asks pardon and expresses love to his corpse as she waits for arrest. In her jail cell, she is supported by a kind matron. At her trial, she is asked to explain how she came to shoot Blaine, and she narrates her story. Blaine courted her and claimed he would marry her, and she left her unloving family to go with him to New Orleans. There, Blaine did not marry her but only took her to a house in a sleazy neighbourhood; in a bedroom there, a mirror vision of herself in bridal attire gave way to a vision of herself in a red dress (strikingly hand-coloured in the film), indicating that she knew she was entering on a life of prostitution. She gave in for love of Blaine, and spent several miserable years servicing men he sent in to her, spurred on by little love notes from him.\nThe mocking prosecutor suggests that she shot Blaine out of jealousy because he was going to marry another woman, and she acknowledges this and points out that he was buying the ring with money she earned for him. Women in the courtroom cry. Despite the prosecutor's finger-wagging and the judge's frivolous boredom, the all-male jury deems her not guilty.\nGabrielle tells the kind matron that she would now like to redeem herself by working to help people, and drops her brilliant red dress on the floor as a sign that she will never go back to that work. Beverly Fontaine, a society matron fond of getting publicity by taking up reformed criminals, invites her to come live at her house. There, she meets the nice chauffeur Terrance O'Day, but is put on display at parties for Beverly's friends and tormented by tactless questions about her prostitution work. Terrance takes her on a sweet, wholesome date to an amusement park, and she realizes that there is a good kind of man she has never encountered before.\nBeverly gets tired of her and goes on a trip, with Terrance driving her, leaving Gabrielle a letter to the superintendent of a local hospital about training as a nurse. The superintendent, however, recognizes her and throws her out. She is unable to get work, losing her job as a maid when she gets upset at seeing her defense attorney's wife wearing her ring she had to give him as her fee. Starving and desperate, she telegraphs to Clara, a supportive friend in the New Orleans brothel, to send her the train fare to return there and take up her old profession. Clara does.\nThe telegraph operator is a friend of Terrance's, and goes to Beverly Fontaine's house to tell him of this just as she and Terrance return from her trip. Terrance throws up his job and commandeers Beverly's car to drive to the train station to stop Gabrielle, but is five minutes too late. He gets on the next train, and, in New Orleans, takes a taxi to the address on the telegram. Meanwhile, Gabrielle, hesitating on the doorstep of the brothel, is attacked by a brute, and is hit by a car as she runs from him. Terrance sees the accident, but does not realize it is she. Hearing from Clara that she has not shown up yet, he hangs around the street looking for her for days.\nGabrielle is recovering in the hospital when she overhears staff people saying that, because the U.S. has just entered World War I and the flu pandemic has started, they are in desperate need of additional nurses and helpers.

        "description": "The Unholy Three is a 1925 American silent film involving a crime spree, directed by Tod Browning and starring Lon Chaney. The supporting cast features Mae Busch, Matt Moore, Victor McLaglen and Harry Earles.\nThe film was remade in 1930 as a talkie. In both the 1925 and the 1930 version, the roles of Professor Echo and Tweedledee are played by Chaney and Earles respectively. The films were based on the novel of the same name by Tod Robbins.\nPlot\nThree performers leave a sideshow after Tweedledee (Harry Earles), a midget performer, assaults a young heckler and sparks a melee. The three join together in an \"unholy\" plan to become wealthy. Prof. Echo, the ventriloquist, assumes the role of Mrs. O'Grady, a kindly old grandmother, who runs a pet shop, while Tweedledee plays her grandchild. Hercules (Victor McLaglen), the strongman, works in the shop along with the unsuspecting Hector McDonald (Matt Moore). Echo's girlfriend, pickpocket Rosie O'Grady (Mae Busch), pretends to be his granddaughter.\nUsing what they learn from delivering pets, the trio later commit burglaries, with their wealthy buyers as victims. On Christmas Eve, John Arlington (an uncredited Charles Wellesley) telephones to complain that the \"talking\" parrot (aided by Echo's ventriloquism) he bought will not speak. When \"Granny\" O'Grady visits him to coax the bird into performing, \"she\" takes along grandson \"Little Willie\". While there, they learn that a valuable ruby necklace is in the house. They decide to steal it that night. As Echo is too busy, the other two grow impatient and decide to go ahead without him.\nThe next day, Echo is furious to read in the newspaper that Arlington was killed and his three-year-old daughter badly injured in the robbery. Hercules shows no remorse whatsoever, relating how Arlington pleaded for his life. When a police investigator shows up at the shop, the trio become fearful and decide to frame Hector, hiding the jewelry in his room.\nMeanwhile, Hector proposes to Rosie. She turns him down, but he overhears her crying after he leaves. To his joy, she confesses she loves him, but was ashamed of her shady past. When the police take him away, Rosie tells the trio that she will exonerate him, forcing them to abduct her and flee to a mountain cabin. Echo takes along his large pet ape (who terrifies Hercules).\nIn the spring, Hector is brought to trial. Rosie pleads with Echo to save Hector, promising to stay with him if he does. After Echo leaves for the city, Tweedledee overhears Hercules asking Rosie to run away with him (and the loot). Tweedledee releases the ape. Hercules kills Tweedledee right before the ape gets him.\nAt the trial, Echo agonizes over what to do, but finally rushes forward and confesses all. Both he and Hector are set free. When Rosie goes to Echo to keep her promise, he lies and says he was only kidding. He tells her to go to Hector. Echo returns to the sideshow, giving his spiel to the customers: \"That's all there is to life, friends, ... a little laughter ... a little tear.\"\nThemes\nAs is common of a Tod Browning film, circus life and unusual bodies play a central role in this movie along with great use of trompe-l'\u0153il optical illusion. Trompe-l'\u0153il is exercised and played with as the illusion of Dr. Echo as \"Mrs. O\u2019Grady\" and Tweedledee as \"Little Willie\". The main plot of the movie revolves around the character\u2019s abilities to pass themselves off convincingly as something they are not, an illusion the movie peels back and reasserts for both the other characters and for the audience themselves. Contrary to the usual use of this effect, Browning makes it a point to disillusion the audience and display the workings of the illusion to create a different sort of viewing stimulation.\nIn most Browning films, his opinion of the deformed and different becomes evident. The three\u2019s plot plays directly with another of Browning\u2019s favorite topics, dealing with identity, doubles, dual roles, and deformity. This film is unique in that the character Tweedledee is the only one of this group of that is played by a deformed character and is malicious in nature.\nCast\nLon Chaney as Prof. Echo, a.k.a. Mrs. O'Grady or \"Granny\"\nMae Busch as Rosie O'Grady\nMatt Moore as Hector McDonald\nVictor McLaglen as Hercules, a.k.a. \"Son-in-Law\"\nHarry Earles as Tweedledee, a.k.a.

        "date": "1897",
        "subject": "boxing",
        "description": "The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight is an 1897 documentary film directed by Enoch J. Rector depicting the 1897 boxing match between James J. Corbett and Bob Fitzsimmons in Carson City, Nevada on St. Patrick's Day. Originally running for more than 100 minutes, it was the longest film released to date; as such, it was the world's first feature film. \nThe technology that allowed this is known as the Latham loop. Rector claimed to have invented the device, but its invention is disputed. He used three such equipped cameras placed adjacently and filming on 63mm nitrate film. Only fragments of the film survive. The known fragments were transferred in the 1980s from a print owned by Jean A. LeRoy of New York City, the transfer done on a specially built optical printer to convert the film to 35mm film. The film was also the first to be shot in widescreen, with an aspect ratio of about 1.65:1. According to Dan Streible, The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight is \"one of the earliest individual productions to sustain public commentary on the cinema.\" The film is so important to film history that Luke McKernan declared, \"it was boxing that created the cinema.\" As noted by Seth Abraham, the president of Time Warner Sports, it was the first motion picture to ever depict the championship prizefight. Its nationwide screenings can be regarded as the first pay-per-view media event in boxing history, for the fight produced more income in box office than in live gate receipts, it was immensely profitable and the picture served as a long-standing model for future amusement entrepreneurs. Prizefighting was illegal in 21 states and many cities and states tried to ban the film, but their efforts to ban fight films was mostly unsuccessful.\nIn 2012, the film was added to the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress as a \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant film\".\nSynopsis\nThe film no longer exists in its entirety; however, it is known from contemporary sources that the film included all fourteen rounds of the event, each round lasting three minutes. This was not unusual for a boxing film, although each round would previously have been presented as a separate attraction. What made this film exceptional is a five-minute introduction that showed former champion John L. Sullivan (whom Corbett defeated in 1892) and his manager, Billy Madden, introducing the event, the introduction of referee George Siler, and both boxers entering the ring in their robes.\nThe one-minute rests between each round were captured on film and when it was reissued it included a ten-minute epilogue of the empty ring at the end of the fight, into which members of the audience eventually stormed. Even with these approximate timings, the film ran a minimum of 71 minutes, and sources generally report that it exceeded 90 or 100 minutes. The film climaxes with Fitzsimmons hitting Corbett in the solar plexus for a knockout and Corbett crawling outside the space of the camera so that he is not visible above the waist.\nProduction\nEnoch J. Rector had been an employee of the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company, which filmed Corbett and Courtney Before the Kinetograph (1894) in six one minute rounds, each exhibited via the Edison Kinetoscope as a separate peep show for a separate fee. Some time after leaving the company, Rector arranged for the film with boxing promoter Dan Stuart. Stuart offered $10,000 to the winner of the bout in an agreement signed by both boxers on 4 January 1897. Corbett, along with his fans, was eager to win back the title that he had lost to Fitzsimmons in Mexico. Producer William Aloysius Brady got an agreement from Rector that 25% of the proceeds of the film would go to him and Corbett; Fitzsimmons and his manager, Martin Julian, would receive $13,000. Fitzsimmons was outraged upon learning of the deal, and the terms were renegotiated. Under the new terms, each boxer and his manager would take 25%, with Rector, Stuart, and Samuel J. Tilden Jr (who had left Kinetoscope with Rector in a battle over who invented the Latham loop) dividing the remaining 50%.\nBirt Acres, a British cinematographist of Barnet, England, who shot footage of the 1896 Henley Royal Regatta on 70mm film using a ratio wider than 1.33 x 1, sought an opportunity and sent a cameraman to the United States to cover the event, but Rector had already secured an exclusive right to picture the event.\nThe film was shot in widescreen format on 2 3/16 gauge film stock. Rector brought 48,000 feet of film stock, the largest amount that had ever been brought on location, and exposed 11,000 feet of it. The night before the match, Stuart cut the ring down from 24 feet to 22 feet for the sake of the camera, but the referee noticed this and Stuart was forced to change it back.\nWyatt Earp was a reporter for The New York World at the time, which published his commentaries on the fight on March 14 and March 18. He disagreed with referee George Siler's decision when Fitzsimmons allegedly hit Corbett in the jaw, which should have resulted in a foul, coming after a knockout blow to Corbett's solar plexus. The World heavily promoted the film, and the day after the film's release, printed a statement from Fitzsimmons, \"I don't believe there is a single picture in it that will substantiate those [claims] published in The World.\"",

Based on the 1912 novel Riders of the Purple Sage by Zane Grey, the film is about a former Texas Ranger who pursues a corrupt lawyer who abducted his married sister and niece. His search leads him to a remote Arizona ranch and the love of a good woman.\nThe film is preserved today.\nPlot\nWhen corrupt lawyer Lew Walters (Warner Oland) is run out of a Texas town, he abducts Millie Erne (Beatrice Burnham) and her young daughter Bess and forces them to accompany him, leaving behind a heartbroken husband and father. Millie's brother, Texas Ranger Jim Carson (Tom Mix), leaves his service behind, takes the name Jim Lassiter, and dedicates his life to finding Walters and his sister and niece. After many years, his search leads him to Cottonwood, Arizona, and the ranch of Jane Withersteen (Mabel Ballin). Jane is attracted to the stranger after he rescues her chief rider, Bern Venders (Harold Goodwin), from being flogged for a crime he did not commit. She tells him that Millie died while searching for her daughter after little Bess was abducted.\nLassiter and Venters go after a gang of rustlers who have been raiding the Withersteen ranch and stealing their cattle. They wound and capture the masked leader of the gang, who turns out to be a young beautiful woman. She is revealed to be Bess Erne (Marion Nixon), Lassiter's long-lost niece. Venters takes charge of the wounded girl, taking her to a secret location, Surprise Valley. The two soon fall in love, and leave the valley to marry.\nMeanwhile, Jane admits to Lassiter that the man he is hunting, Lew Walters, is in fact a local judge, now calling himself Judge Dyer. Lassiter rides into town and rushes into Dyer's courtroom, shooting the villain with deadly precision. Soon after, a posse is formed and goes after Lassiter, who flees with Jane and her adopted ward, Fay Larkin (Dawn O'Day), into the mountains surrounding Surprise Valley. They take refuge from their pursuers on a high plateau overlooking the entrance to the valley. The only approach to their hiding place is by a set of stairs cut into the side of the cliff. Lassiter rolls a boulder down from the heights to block the posse's path. There is now no way out. He, Jane and little Fay are trapped inside Surprise Valley forever.\nCast\nTom Mix as Jim Carson / Jim Lassiter\nMabel Ballin as Jane Withersteen\nWarner Oland as Lew Walkers / Judge Dyer\nBeatrice Burnham as Millie Erne\nArthur Morrison as Frank Erne\nWilfred Lucas as Oldring\nCharles Le Moyne as Richard Tull\nHarold Goodwin as Bern Venters\nHank Bell as Barfly (uncredited)\nGary Cooper as Rider (uncredited)\nSeessel Anne Johnson as Bess Erne, as a Child (uncredited)\nFred Kohler as Henchman Tom Metzger (uncredited)\nCharles Newton as Henchman Joe Herd (uncredited)\nMarian Nixon as Bess Erne (uncredited)\nJoe Rickson as Henchman Dave Slack (uncredited)\nAnne Shirley as Fay Larkin (uncredited)\nTony the Wonder Horse as Jim's horse",

Mollie expresses admiration for the rugged men of the west, and Bill decides to go to his Uncle Lester's (Edmund Breese) ranch to man up and deserve Mollie's love. Upon arrival he finds that the west isn't quite so wild anymore, with cowboys herding cows in cars and his uncle spending a lot of time on the golf course. Bill settles in to enjoy his stay, but after a while Mollie announces she is coming for a visit. Bill and Uncle Lester cook up a plan to pass as rugged for a day or so, forcing the cowboys onto horses and dressing the servants up as Native Americans, and Mollie is fooled. When she decides to stay longer, Bill puts on a show of being too rugged. He eats with atrocious table manners and picks a fight with a farmhand.

        "description": "Beau Brummel is a 1924 American silent film historical drama starring John Barrymore and Mary Astor. The film was directed by Harry Beaumont and based upon Clyde Fitch's 1890 play, which had been performed by Richard Mansfield, and depicts the life of the British Regency dandy Beau Brummell.\nSeveral years after Barrymore's death, his daughter Diana Barrymore was shown a special screening of this film as she had never seen her father in any of his silent films.\nIn 1952, the film entered the public domain in the United States because Warner Bros. did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.\nPlot\nIn 1795, the cream of English aristocracy attend the wedding of \"tradesman's daughter\" Margery. She loves Beau Brummel, a penniless captain in the Tenth Hussars, but has been pressured into agreeing to marry Lord Alvanley, exchanging her family's wealth for social standing and a title. When Brummel comes to see her just before the wedding, she begs him to take her away, but her ambitious mother, Mrs. Wertham, intervenes, and Margery gives way. Embittered, Brummel decides to seek revenge against society using his \"charm, wit and personal appearance\".\nAt a dinner given by the Prince of Wales for the officers of his regiment, the Prince is attracted to Mrs. Snodgrass, the innkeeper's wife. When Brummel rescues him from the irate husband, he takes a great liking to the captain, enabling Brummel to attach himself to His Royal Highness.\nBy 1811, Brummel has made his house in London the \"rendezvous of the smart world\" and himself the arbiter of fashion. When Lord Henry Stanhope catches him dallying with his infatuated wife, a duel ensues. Lord Henry misses, whereupon Brummel fires his pistol into the air. Afterward, however, Brummel informs Lady Hester Stanhope that he never loved her. She attracts the attention of the womanizing Prince.\nShe and another enemy he has made set out to turn the Prince against him. Brummel unwittingly helps them, having become too sure of his position; he is rude to his royal friend. Brummel turns his attentions to the Duchess of York, the Prince's sister-in-law. She agrees to a late night private supper, but Lady Margery shows up first. She warns him that his enemies are hard at work; one knows about the rendezvous. The Prince arrives unannounced, expecting to find the Duchess, but is (pleasantly) surprised to find Lady Margery instead. When she rejects his initial advances, he offers to appoint Brummel the Ambassador to France. Lady Margery is delighted at the prospect, but it is all for naught. Shortly afterward, the two men quarrel openly, and neither is interested in a reconciliation.\nNo longer able to fend off his creditors as a result of the withdrawal of the Prince's favor, Brummel flees to Calais to avoid going to debtors prison, accompanied only by his loyal butler Mortimer. Years pass, and the Prince, now King George IV, stops at Calais. In his entourage is Lady Margery. Both see Brummel standing by the side of the road. Without his master's knowledge, Mortimer goes to see the King, pretending to represent Brummel in an effort to heal the breach. When Brummel finds out, he discharges Mortimer. Lady Margery comes to see Brummel in his garret. Her husband has died, and she asks him to marry her. He turns her down, saying he is too worn out and tired, perhaps even of love. After she departs, his resolution wavers, but he regains control of himself.\nIn old age, Brummel ends up in the hospital prison of Bon Saveur. The ever-faithful Mortimer visits him, but Brummel's mind has deteriorated - he does not recognize his old servant at first. Mortimer informs him that the King has died and that Lady Margery is very ill. The scene shifts to the latter's bed. Her spirit leaves her body and travels to Brummel's cell. When Brummel also dies, their youthful souls are joyfully reunited.\nCast\nJohn Barrymore as George Bryan \"Beau\" Brummel\nMary Astor as Lady Margery Alvanley\nWillard Louis as Prince of Wales\nCarmel Myers as Lady Hester Stanhope\nIrene Rich as Frederica Charlotte, Duchess of York, sister-in-law of the Prince of Wales\nAlec B.

H. Chaldecotte as Timothy\nF. F. Guenste as Parkyns, valet to the Prince of Wales\nBeaudine Anderson as child (uncredited)\nProduction\nShooting on the film began in September 1923.\nBarrymore and Astor were conducting an affair during filming.\nBarrymore and Willard Louis, who played the Prince of Wales, frequently told bawdy jokes rather than say their lines, since it was a silent film. However, they did not take into account deaf audience members who could lip read what they were saying. Many of these patrons wrote to complain about the actors' antics.\nThe picture was a remake of a 1913 version and was in turn remade in 1954 with Stewart Granger, Elizabeth Taylor and Peter Ustinov, although the latter film restored the original spelling of \"Brummell.\"",

        "description": "The Red Kimono (spelled as \"The Red Kimona\" in the opening credits) is a 1925 American silent drama film about prostitution produced by Dorothy Davenport (billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid) and starring Priscilla Bonner. This is the debut film of Director Walter Lang.\nThe title comes from a red-colored dress shown through the film, meant to symbolize the main character's occupation as a \"scarlet woman\" (a prostitute).\nPlot\nA woman, Gabrielle Darley, shoots a man, Howard Blaine, in the back as he is buying a wedding ring, then asks pardon and expresses love to his corpse as she waits for arrest. In her jail cell, she is supported by a kind matron. At her trial, she is asked to explain how she came to shoot Blaine, and she narrates her story. Blaine courted her and claimed he would marry her, and she left her unloving family to go with him to New Orleans. There, Blaine did not marry her but only took her to a house in a sleazy neighbourhood; in a bedroom there, a mirror vision of herself in bridal attire gave way to a vision of herself in a red dress (strikingly hand-coloured in the film), indicating that she knew she was entering on a life of prostitution. She gave in for love of Blaine, and spent several miserable years servicing men he sent in to her, spurred on by little love notes from him.\nThe mocking prosecutor suggests that she shot Blaine out of jealousy because he was going to marry another woman, and she acknowledges this and points out that he was buying the ring with money she earned for him. Women in the courtroom cry. Despite the prosecutor's finger-wagging and the judge's frivolous boredom, the all-male jury deems her not guilty.\nGabrielle tells the kind matron that she would now like to redeem herself by working to help people, and drops her brilliant red dress on the floor as a sign that she will never go back to that work. Beverly Fontaine, a society matron fond of getting publicity by taking up reformed criminals, invites her to come live at her house. There, she meets the nice chauffeur Terrance O'Day, but is put on display at parties for Beverly's friends and tormented by tactless questions about her prostitution work. Terrance takes her on a sweet, wholesome date to an amusement park, and she realizes that there is a good kind of man she has never encountered before.\nBeverly gets tired of her and goes on a trip, with Terrance driving her, leaving Gabrielle a letter to the superintendent of a local hospital about training as a nurse. The superintendent, however, recognizes her and throws her out. She is unable to get work, losing her job as a maid when she gets upset at seeing her defense attorney's wife wearing her ring she had to give him as her fee. Starving and desperate, she telegraphs to Clara, a supportive friend in the New Orleans brothel, to send her the train fare to return there and take up her old profession. Clara does.\nThe telegraph operator is a friend of Terrance's, and goes to Beverly Fontaine's house to tell him of this just as she and Terrance return from her trip. Terrance throws up his job and commandeers Beverly's car to drive to the train station to stop Gabrielle, but is five minutes too late. He gets on the next train, and, in New Orleans, takes a taxi to the address on the telegram. Meanwhile, Gabrielle, hesitating on the doorstep of the brothel, is attacked by a brute, and is hit by a car as she runs from him. Terrance sees the accident, but does not realize it is she. Hearing from Clara that she has not shown up yet, he hangs around the street looking for her for days.\nGabrielle is recovering in the hospital when she overhears staff people saying that, because the U.S. has just entered World War I and the flu pandemic has started, they are in desperate need of additional nurses and helpers. She offers herself, and is hired. She is scrubbing the hospital floor when Terrance enters in uniform, having enlisted and serving as an ambulance driver. They are reunited, and he asks her to marry him before he goes overseas. She declares her love but postpones their marriage till he comes back and she has worked longer and become worthy of a happy life with him.\nA woman who has been keeping an album of clippings about Gabrielle, who seems to be Beverly's maid, tells us that this happy life was attained for these two. But Gabrielle is only one of many women in this terrible situation, she says, and it is up to all women to help their unfortunate sisters.\nCast\nPriscilla Bonner as Gabrielle Darley\nNellie Bly Baker as Clara Johnson, Gabrielle's neighbor\nCarl Miller as Howard Blaine\nMary Carr as Prison Matron\nVirginia Pearson as Mrs. Beverly Fontaine\nTyrone Power, Sr. as Gabrielle's father\nSheldon Lewis as District Attorney\nTheodore von Eltz as Terrance O'Day or, Freddy Fred the Chauffeur\nEmily Fitzroy as The Housekeeper\nGeorge Siegmann as Mr. Mack, A Client\nDot Farley as Inquisitive Woman\nMax Asher as H.E.

        "description": "The Big Parade is a 1925 American silent war drama film directed by King Vidor, starring John Gilbert, Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e, Hobart Bosworth, Tom O'Brien, and Karl Dane. Written by World War I veteran, Laurence Stallings, the film is about an idle rich boy who joins the US Army's Rainbow Division and is sent to France to fight in World War I, becomes a friend of two working class men, experiences the horrors of trench warfare, and finds love with a French girl.\nThe film has been praised for its realistic depiction of warfare, and it heavily influenced a great many subsequent war films, especially All Quiet on the Western Front (1930). The Big Parade is regarded as one of the greatest films made about World War I, and in 1992 it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.\nPlot\nIn the United States in 1917, James \"Jim\" Apperson's (John Gilbert) idleness (in contrast to his hardworking brother) incurs the great displeasure of his wealthy businessman father. Then America enters World War I. Jim informs his worried mother that he has no intention of enlisting, and his father threatens to kick him out of the house if he does not join. However, when he runs into his patriotic friends at a send-off parade, he is persuaded to enlist, making his father very proud.\nDuring training, Jim makes friendships with Southern construction worker Slim (Karl Dane) and Bronx bartender Bull (Tom O'Brien). Their unit ships out to France, where they are billeted at a farm in the village of Champillon in the Marne.\nAll three men are attracted to Melisande (Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e), whose mother owns the farm. She repulses all their advances, but gradually warms to Jim, bonding at first over chewing gum. They eventually fall in love, despite not being able to speak each other's language. One day, however, Jim receives a letter and a photograph from Justyn (Claire Adams), which reveals that they are engaged. When Melisande sees the picture, she realizes the situation and runs off in tears. Before Jim can decide what to do, his unit is ordered to the front. Melisande hears the commotion and races back, just in time for the lovers to embrace and kiss.\nThe Americans march towards the front and are strafed by an enemy fighter before it is shot down. The unit is sent to the attack immediately, advancing against snipers and machine guns in the woods, then more machine guns, artillery, and poison gas in the open. They settle down in a makeshift line. Jim shelters in a shellhole with Slim and Bull.\nThat night, orders come down for one man to go out and eliminate a troublesome mortar crew; Slim wins a spitting contest for the opportunity. He succeeds, but is spotted and wounded on the way back. After listening to Slim's pleas for help, Jim cannot stand it any longer and goes to his rescue against orders. Bull follows, but is shot and killed. By the time Jim reaches Slim, he is already dead. Jim is then shot in the leg. When a German (George Beranger) comes to finish him off, Jim shoots and wounds him. The German starts crawling back to his line. Jim catches up to him in another shellhole, but, face to face, cannot bring himself to finish him off with his bayonet. Instead, he gives his erstwhile enemy a cigarette. Soon after, the German dies. However, Jim is not stuck in no man's land for long; the Americans attack, and he is taken away to a hospital.\nFrom another patient, he learns that Champillon has changed hands four times. Worried about Melisande, Jim sneaks out of the hospital and hitches a ride. When he gets to the farmhouse, he finds it damaged and empty. Melisande and her mother have joined a stream of refugees. Jim collapses and is carried off in an ambulance by retreating soldiers.\nAfter the war ends, Jim goes home to America. Before he arrives, his mother overhears Justyn and Jim's brother Harry (Robert Ober) discussing what to do; in Jim's absence, they have fallen in love. When Jim appears, it is revealed that he has had his leg amputated. Later, Jim tells his mother about Melisande; she tells him to go back and find her. When he returns to the farm, Melisande rushes into his arms.\nCast\nJohn Gilbert as James Apperson\nRen\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e as Melisande\nHobart Bosworth as Mr. Apperson\nClaire McDowell as Mrs. Apperson\nClaire Adams as Justyn Reed\nRobert Ober as Harry Apperson\nTom O'Brien as Bull\nKarl Dane as Slim\nRosita Marstini as Melisande's mother\nHarry Crocker as Soldier (uncredited)\nJulanne Johnston as Justine Devereux\nKathleen Key as Apperson sister\nCarl Voss as Officer (uncredited)\nGeorge Beranger as German soldier\nFrank Currier\nDan Mason",

        "description": "The Red Kimono (spelled as \"The Red Kimona\" in the opening credits) is a 1925 American silent drama film about prostitution produced by Dorothy Davenport (billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid) and starring Priscilla Bonner. This is the debut film of Director Walter Lang.\nThe title comes from a red-colored dress shown through the film, meant to symbolize the main character's occupation as a \"scarlet woman\" (a prostitute).\nPlot\nA woman, Gabrielle Darley, shoots a man, Howard Blaine, in the back as he is buying a wedding ring, then asks pardon and expresses love to his corpse as she waits for arrest. In her jail cell, she is supported by a kind matron. At her trial, she is asked to explain how she came to shoot Blaine, and she narrates her story. Blaine courted her and claimed he would marry her, and she left her unloving family to go with him to New Orleans. There, Blaine did not marry her but only took her to a house in a sleazy neighbourhood; in a bedroom there, a mirror vision of herself in bridal attire gave way to a vision of herself in a red dress (strikingly hand-coloured in the film), indicating that she knew she was entering on a life of prostitution. She gave in for love of Blaine, and spent several miserable years servicing men he sent in to her, spurred on by little love notes from him.\nThe mocking prosecutor suggests that she shot Blaine out of jealousy because he was going to marry another woman, and she acknowledges this and points out that he was buying the ring with money she earned for him. Women in the courtroom cry. Despite the prosecutor's finger-wagging and the judge's frivolous boredom, the all-male jury deems her not guilty.\nGabrielle tells the kind matron that she would now like to redeem herself by working to help people, and drops her brilliant red dress on the floor as a sign that she will never go back to that work. Beverly Fontaine, a society matron fond of getting publicity by taking up reformed criminals, invites her to come live at her house. There, she meets the nice chauffeur Terrance O'Day, but is put on display at parties for Beverly's friends and tormented by tactless questions about her prostitution work. Terrance takes her on a sweet, wholesome date to an amusement park, and she realizes that there is a good kind of man she has never encountered before.\nBeverly gets tired of her and goes on a trip, with Terrance driving her, leaving Gabrielle a letter to the superintendent of a local hospital about training as a nurse. The superintendent, however, recognizes her and throws her out. She is unable to get work, losing her job as a maid when she gets upset at seeing her defense attorney's wife wearing her ring she had to give him as her fee. Starving and desperate, she telegraphs to Clara, a supportive friend in the New Orleans brothel, to send her the train fare to return there and take up her old profession. Clara does.\nThe telegraph operator is a friend of Terrance's, and goes to Beverly Fontaine's house to tell him of this just as she and Terrance return from her trip. Terrance throws up his job and commandeers Beverly's car to drive to the train station to stop Gabrielle, but is five minutes too late. He gets on the next train, and, in New Orleans, takes a taxi to the address on the telegram. Meanwhile, Gabrielle, hesitating on the doorstep of the brothel, is attacked by a brute, and is hit by a car as she runs from him. Terrance sees the accident, but does not realize it is she. Hearing from Clara that she has not shown up yet, he hangs around the street looking for her for days.\nGabrielle is recovering in the hospital when she overhears staff people saying that, because the U.S. has just entered World War I and the flu pandemic has started, they are in desperate need of additional nurses and helpers. She offers herself, and is hired. She is scrubbing the hospital floor when Terrance enters in uniform, having enlisted and serving as an ambulance driver. They are reunited, and he asks her to marry him before he goes overseas. She declares her love but postpones their marriage till he comes back and she has worked longer and become worthy of a happy life with him.\nA woman who has been keeping an album of clippings about Gabrielle, who seems to be Beverly's maid, tells us that this happy life was attained for these two. But Gabrielle is only one of many women in this terrible situation, she says, and it is up to all women to help their unfortunate sisters.\nCast\nPriscilla Bonner as Gabrielle Darley\nNellie Bly Baker as Clara Johnson, Gabrielle's neighbor\nCarl Miller as Howard Blaine\nMary Carr as Prison Matron\nVirginia Pearson as Mrs. Beverly Fontaine\nTyrone Power, Sr. as Gabrielle's father\nSheldon Lewis as District Attorney\nTheodore von Eltz as Terrance O'Day or, Freddy Fred the Chauffeur\nEmily Fitzroy as The Housekeeper\nGeorge Siegmann as Mr. Mack, A Client\nDot Farley as Inquisitive Woman\nMax Asher as H.E.

When Captain Pyke is shot, Holmes keys in on his mysterious Chinese widow as well as the shady Merrydew. Other members keep dying--Malcom Dearing first, then Mr. Baker. There is also an attempt on the life of young Eileen Forrester, who became a reluctant society member upon the death of her father.

        "description": "Don Q, Son of Zorro is a 1925 American silent romantic adventure film that is sequel to the 1920 silent film The Mark of Zorro. It was loosely based upon the 1909 novel Don Q.'s Love Story, written by the mother-and-son duo Kate and Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard. The story was reworked in 1925 (after Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard's death) into a vehicle for the Johnston McCulley character Zorro. \nThe film was well-received: the New York Times rated it one of its top ten movies of 1925.\nPlot\nDon Diego de la Vega (Zorro)'s son, Cesar (Douglas Fairbanks), is in Spain finishing his education. While Cesar is showing off to friends his remarkable prowess with the whip, he accidentally clips off the feather shako on the hat of Don Sebastian (Donald Crisp) of the Palace Guard. Although Cesar apologizes immediately, Sebastian is unforgiving. Their duel is interrupted by a runaway bull. Trapped on the ground with his sword belt tangled in his boot, certain to be gored by the bull, Sebastian is saved at the last minute by Cesar. This further infuriates him. The action is observed by Queen Isabella (Stella De Lanti) and her guest, Austrian Archduke Paul (Warner Oland); she requests Cesar's company immediately. Another friend of Cesar, Don Fabrique Borusta (Jean Hersholt), offers to bring him to Her Majesty.\nMeanwhile, Cesar encounters Dolores (Mary Astor), daughter of his father's old friend, General de Muro (Jack McDonald), as she poses for a sculptor. It is love at first sight. But Sebastian, who comes from a poor family, has set his sights on Dolores and her family's wealth, and is determined to win her. Later, the Archduke invites Cesar to paint the town, with Sebastian as their \"duenna.\" In a local tavern the Archduke offends the patrons, all seeming ruffians, by flirting with the dancer. Sebastian contrives his and the Duke's escape, but locks Cesar in the tavern to defend himself against the cutthroats. In the carriage that takes them away from what he is sure will be Cesar's death, Sebastian declares he has a meeting with Dolores. The Archduke invites himself along. While Sebastian asks the General for his daughter's hand, the Archduke sees Dolores serenaded by Cesar, who escaped (easily) and even acquired a guitar as a souvenir. Seeing the reactions of the young couple, the Archduke knows Cesar has won Dolores's heart.\nAlthough penniless, Don Fabrique has designs on succeeding in society. He glues together a discarded invitation to the Archduke\u2019s Grand Ball, and crashes the party. At the ball, Cesar and Sebastian sit on either side of Dolores, both seeming frustrated in their efforts to woo her. The Archduke summons her to him. When Cesar sees the Archduke caress Dolores's cheek, Cesar becomes jealous and goes to confront him. But the Archduke assures him that he is working in Cesar's favor, and proves it by dragging Sebastian to another room to play cards while Cesar and Dolores dance together. Cesar pulls Dolores to a balcony for ardent lovemaking. Fabrique sees them; when the pair are interrupted by Dolores\u2019s father, General de Muro, who recognizes Cesar and is ready to give his blessing, Fabrique believes they are about to be betrothed.\nIn the card room, the Archduke declares that Sebastian is as unlucky at cards as he is in love. Franque tiptoes in, and tells the Archduke that he saw Cesar and Dolores kissing: surely they will be married now. The Archduke summons Cesar to congratulate him, to the horror of Sebastian. When he enters, Cesar is offended at the impropriety of this news, and learns that the source was Fabrique. Such bad manners should not go unpunished. He informs the Archduke that someone here doesn't belong, and asks if he should remove him. Archduke Paul nods, and Cesar pulls Fabrique out of the room by tugging his nose.\nThe Archduke continues to taunt Sebastian, a foolish move when Sebastian, enraged by jealousy, pulls his sword and stabs the Archduke before he realizes what he has done. He hides when Cesar, hearing something, enters, then strikes Cesar unconscious. He frames him for the Archduke's murder, then casually leaves. With his last dying energy, the Archduke pulls a playing card off the table and writes on it: Sebastian assassinated me. Archduke Paul.\nFabrique enters, finds Cesar unconscious, finds the playing card and, miffed at Cesar's insult, takes it. Shortly thereafter he confronts Sebastian with his demands: to be appointed Civil Governor. Both stand by while the Guard arrests Cesar for the murder and orders his immediate execution to prevent an international incident. But General de Muro offers Cesar a gentleman\u2019s way out by giving him a dagger. Cesar pretends to stab himself and falls to the moat below the castle.\nMonths pass, while Cesar hides in the ruins of the old family castle. He pretends to be Don Q, for \"a trick must be answered by a trick!\" Fabrique has become Civil Governor, receiving regular pay-offs from Sebastian. Fabrique has even taken over Carlo's servants, and maidservant Lola (Lottie Pickford), seeing how Sebastian behaves around Fabrique, runs to tell Cesar that although gossip says they are close friends, in truth Sebastian is afraid of Fabrique. This will prove the leverage Cesar needs to establish his innocence.\nAfter months of mourning over Cesar, Dolores is pushed to marry Sebastian. Just as she is about to sign the marriage contract with Sebastian, Cesar appears at the window. He is alive! The Queen orders Cesar\u2019s arrest. The best man to find him: that one-eyed ferret, Colonel Matsado (Albert MacQuarrie). But when Matsado stops at a country inn on his way into the city, Cesar waylays him, steals his uniform, and impersonates him. Back in the city Cesar as Matsado pretends to beat his (now Fabrique's) old manservant Robledo (Charles Stevens) for information on Cesar's whereabouts, then convinces Fabrique to accompany him to the ruins where Cesar has been living these past months. There he is determined to find what hold Fabrique has on Sebastian.\nIn a whirlwind finish, Sebastian and the real Matsado track Cesar to his lair, as do his father, Zorro (Fairbanks), who with the mute faithful family servant Bernardo (Tote Du Crow), has sailed from California to Spain to help. On the way to the ruins they pass Dolores and her mother along the same road. Finally, as all gather at the ruins, Zorro and Don Q battle the soldiers, Fabrique confesses, Sebastian is beaten, de Muro recognizes his old friend, the villains are arrested, and Cesar and Dolores reunited.\nCast\nDouglas Fairbanks as Don Cesar de Vega / Zorro\nMary Astor as Dolores de Muro\nJack McDonald as Gen. de Muro\nDonald Crisp as Don Sebastian\nStella De Lanti as the Queen\nWarner Oland as The Archduke\nJean Hersholt as Don Fabrique Borusta\nAlbert MacQuarrie as Colonel Maatsado\nLottie Pickford as Lola (credited Lottie Pickford Forrest)\nCharles Stevens as Robledo\nTote Du Crow as Bernardo\nMartha Franklin as The Duenna\nJuliette Belanger as The Danger\nRoy Coulson as Dancer's Admirer\nEnrique Acosta as Ramon",

It was directed by Herbert Brenon and starred Betty Bronson as Peter Pan, Ernest Torrence as Captain Hook, Mary Brian as Wendy, Virginia Browne Faire as Tinker Bell, Esther Ralston as Mrs. Darling, and Anna May Wong as the American Indian princess Tiger Lily.\nPlot\nAs described in a review in a film magazine, Mrs. Darling (Ralston) is worried because she has seen a boyish face at the nursery window and found a shadow on the floor, but reluctantly goes to a party with her husband (Chadwick). Because Mr. Darling is so strict, the family cannot keep a nurse, so the three children are left in the charge of the dog Nana (Ali). Soon the lively boy Peter Pan (Bronson) appears at the window with the fairy Tinker Bell (Faire), and he finds his shadow in a desk drawer. Wendy (Brian), the oldest child, awakens and sees Peter, and he tells her of his home in the woods and about the fairies. Peter teaches the children to fly and they go away to Never Never Land to join the colony of Lost Boys, who have fallen out of carriages when their nurses were not looking. Tinker Bell is jealous and prompts one of the Lost Boys to shoot Wendy, thinking she is a bird, and she almost dies. The boys, who live in an underground home, adopt Wendy as their mother. A band of American Indians is friendly and battle a band of pirates led by Captain Hook (Torrence), but are defeated. The Captain hates Peter because he blames him for a crocodile that once bit off his hand. Because the crocodile follows him, the Captain fears him and fed it an alarm clock so that its tick-tock will warn him of its approach. The pirates carry off the children and leave poison in Peter's medicine. Tinker Bell drinks the poison and almost dies, but is saved when the children in the audience say that they believe in fairies. Peter enlists the aid of mermaids to get aboard the pirate ship and, with the help of the Proud Boys, they fight and conquer the pirates. Wendy and the children then fly back home. Mrs. Darling, who has grieved, thinks she is dreaming when she sees her children until the rush up on her. Wendy wants to keep Peter, but he says he never wants to grow up. Mrs. Darling agrees to allow Wendy to go back once a year to help Peter with his spring cleaning, and he leaves to go back to the home in the woods. Mr. and Mrs. Darling adopt all of the Lost Boys.\nCast\nBetty Bronson as Peter Pan\nErnest Torrence as Captain Hook\nMary Brian as Wendy Darling\nJack Murphy as John Darling\nPhilippe De Lacy as Michael Darling\nVirginia Brown Faire as Tinker Bell\nGeorge Ali as Nana the dog and Crocodile\nEsther Ralston as Mrs. Darling\nCyril Chadwick as Mr. Darling\nAnna May Wong as Tiger Lily\nMaurice Murphy as Tootles\nMickey McBan as Slightly\nGeorge Crane Jr. as Curly\nWinston Doty as 1st Twin\nWeston Doty as 2nd Twin\nTerence McMillan as Nibs\nLouis Morrison as Gentleman Starkey\nEdward Kipling as Smee\nRobert Milasch as Kelt",

It is an adaption of the 1918 novel The Magnificent Ambersons by Booth Tarkington.\nAs described in a review in a film magazine, twenty-five or thirty years ago, every small town boasted of its Amberson family, whose home was the show place and whose every move made news. Major Amberson's (King) daughter Isabel (Calhoun) loves Eugene Morgan (Forrest), but he gets himself in disgrace by performing a drunken serenade, and leaves town. Isabel marries Wilbur Minafer (MacDonald), a poor second choice, who makes a very passable husband. Not loving her husband, Isabel centers all of the love in her heart upon her son George, who naturally grows from a very spoiled young boy into a despicable young cad. His extravagances eventually deplete the Amberson fortune. When his father dies, George resents his mother's love for Morgan, who has returned as a prosperous automobile manufacturer. George has come to love, however, Morgan's daughter Lucy (Merriam). The death of Major Amberson forces George to go to work, bringing about his regeneration. Then there is the heroic rescue of Isabel by Morgan when the home in which she lodges burns. The final tableau suggests the rehabilitation of George.\nCast\nCullen Landis as George Minafer\nBen Alexander as George Minafer, as a child\nAllan Forrest as Eugene Morgan\nAlice Calhoun as Isabel Minafer\nEmmett King as Major Amberson\nWallace MacDonald as Wilbur Minafer\nCharlotte Merriam as Lucy Morgan\nKathryn Adams as Fanny Minafer\nAggie Herring as Mrs. Foster\nWilliam Irving as George Amberson",

Although she had previously spent all her life in India, Sarah adapts well to her new surroundings. However, things take a turn for the worse when her father is reported dead in battle and his South African financial holdings confiscated by the enemy, leaving her alone and penniless. This film is a bid-budget (1.5 million dollars per wikipedia) adaptation of the novel of the same name by Frances Rodgson Burnett. Little Lord Fauntleroy (1937), which is also in the public domain and available on the archive, is another bid-budget adaptation of one of her novels. The film was originally available elsewhere on the archive as a 3.1GB MPEG2. The files offered here are smaller and more accessible to people who might otherwise be discouraged by the sheer size of the MPEG2. The MPEG4 is a 2-pass, de-telecined H264 transcoding (using HandBrake 0.9.4) of the 3.1GB MPEG2 mentioned above. The AVI is a different print obtained from the Public Domain Torrents site.

        "description": "The Freshman is a 1925 comedy film that tells the story of a college freshman trying to become popular by joining the school football team. It stars Harold Lloyd, Jobyna Ralston, Brooks Benedict, and James Anderson. It remains one of Lloyd's most successful and enduring films.\nThe film was written by John Grey, Sam Taylor, Tim Whelan, and Ted Wilde. It was directed by Fred C. Newmeyer and Sam Taylor.\nIn 1990, The Freshman was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", going in the second year of voting and being one of the first 50 films to receive such an honor.\nPlot\nHarold Lamb (Harold Lloyd), a bright-eyed but na\u00efve young man, enrolls at Tate University. On the train there, he meets Peggy (Jobyna Ralston). They are attracted to each other.\nHarold decides that the best way to ensure his popularity at school is to emulate his movie idol, The College Hero, down to mimicking a little jig he does before greeting anyone, and taking his nickname, \"Speedy\". However, the College Cad (Brooks Benedict) quickly makes him the butt of an ongoing joke, of which the freshman remains blissfully unaware. Harold thinks he is popular, when in fact he is the laughingstock of the whole school. His only real friend is Peggy, who turns out to be his landlady's daughter. She is described in one of the film's title cards as \"the kind of girl your mother must have been\".\nHe tries out for the football team. The coach (Pat Harmon) is unimpressed, but as Harold has damaged their only practice tackle dummy, the coach uses him in its place. At the end of practice, though, he approves of Harold's enthusiasm (undiminished after repeated tackling). The coach is about to dismiss the freshman when Chet Trask (James Anderson), the captain and star of the team, suggests making him their water boy, while letting him think he has made the squad.\nHarold is persuaded to host the annual \"Fall Frolic\" dance. His tailor is late making his suit; with the dance well underway, it is barely being held together by basting stitches, but Harold puts it on and hopes for the best. During the party, his clothes start to fall apart, despite the efforts of the tailor (hiding in a side room) to effect repairs. When Harold sees the College Cad being too forward with Peggy, working as a hatcheck girl, Harold knocks him down. The incensed Cad then tells him just what everyone really thinks of him. Peggy advises him to stop putting on an act and be himself.\nHarold is determined to prove himself by getting into the big football game. His chance comes when the other team proves too tough, injuring so many of Tate College's players that the coach runs out of substitutes. Hounded by Harold and warned by the referee that he will forfeit if he cannot come up with another player, the coach reluctantly lets Harold go in. The first few plays are disastrous. Finally, he breaks free and is on his way to winning the game, but, mindful of a referee's prior instruction that he is to stop playing when he hears the whistle, he drops the football just outside the end zone when a non-football whistle sounds. The other team recovers the ball with only a minute left to play. His teammates are disheartened, but Harold rouses them to make a final effort. He chases down the opposing ball carrier, knocks the football loose, scoops it up and runs it all the way back for the winning touchdown as time runs out, which at last earns him the respect and popularity he was after. To top it off, Peggy passes him a note proclaiming her love for him.\nCast\nHarold Lloyd as The Freshman\nJobyna Ralston as Peggy\nBrooks Benedict as The College Cad\nJames Anderson as The College Hero\nHazel Keener as The College Belle\nJoseph Harrington as The College Tailor\nPat Harmon as The Football Coach\nPete the Pup has a cameo in the movie.",

Matheson was not impressed by Romero's interpretation, feeling that \"It was ... kind of cornball\",\n\nRusso and Romero revised the screenplay while filming. Karl Hardman attributed the edits to lead actor Duane Jones:\n\n\nEastman modified cellar scenes featuring dialogue between Helen and Harry Cooper. One example offered by O'Dea concerns a scene where Barbra tells Ben about Johnny's death:\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography\nFile:EvansCityCemetery PA.jpg Cemetery in 2007.}}}\nThe small budget dictated much of the production process. According to Hardman, \"We knew that we could not raise enough money to shoot a film on a par with the classic horror films with which we had all grown up. The best that we could do was to place our cast in a remote spot and then bring the horror to be visited on them in that spot\".< name=\"Hardman/Eastmaninterview\"/> Scenes were filmed near Evans City, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania,  north of Pittsburgh in rural Butler County, Pennsylvania; the opening sequence was shot at the Evans City Cemetery on Franklin Road, south of the borough. The interior upstairs scenes were filmed in a downtown Evans City home that later became the offices of a prominent local physician and family doctor (Allsop). This home is still standing on South Washington St. (locally called Former state routes in Pennsylvania#PA 855), between the intersecting streets of South Jackson and Van Buren. The cemetery chapel was under warrant for demolition; however, Gary R. Steiner led a successful effort to raise $50,000 to restore the building, and the chapel is currently undergoing renovations.< name=\"fix\"></>< name=\"trib\"></>\n\nThe outdoor, indoor (downstairs) and basement scenes were filmed at a location northeast of Evans City, near a park. The basement door (external view) shown in the film was cut into a wall by the production team and led nowhere. As this house was scheduled for demolition, damage during filming was permitted. The site is now a Sod.</> Romero's decision to direct Night of the Living Dead essentially launched his career as a horror director. He took the helm of the sequels as well as Season of the Witch (1972 film) (1972), The Crazies (1973 film) (1973), Martin (film) (1977), Creepshow (1982) and The Dark Half (film) (1993).\n\nSound effects were created by WRS Studio in Pittsburgh. \"Sound engineer Richard Lococo recorded all of the live sound effects used in the film\". Lococo recalled, \"Of all the sound effects that we created, the one that still gives me goose bumps when I hear it, is Marilyn's screaming as [Helen Cooper] is killed by her daughter. Judy O'Dea's screaming is a close second. Both were looped in and out of echo over and over again\".\nSoundtrack\n\n| Recorded   = \n| Genre      = Soundtrack\n| Label      = Var\u00e8se Sarabande\n| Producer   = Scot W. Holton\n| Compiler   = Scot Holton\n}}\n\nThe musical score was a re-use of the music soundtrack from The Hideous Sun Demon (1959) in the public domain.\n\nA soundtrack album featuring music and dialogue cues from the film was compiled and released on LP by Var\u00e8se Sarabande in 1982; it has never been reissued on CD. In 2008, recording group 400 Lonely Things released the album Tonight of the Living Dead, \"an instrumental album composed entirely of ambient music and sound effects sampled from Romero's 1968 horror classic\".\nIn 2010, the record company Zero Day Releasing released the CD They Won't Stay Dead!: Music from the soundtrack of Night of the Living Dead. It features all-new digitally restored audio from original library LPs and reels.\n\n\nControversy\nNight of the Living Dead premiered on October 1, 1968 at the Fulton Theater in Pittsburgh. The Motion Picture Association of America film rating system was not in place until November 1968, so even young children were not prohibited from purchasing tickets. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times] chided theater owners and parents who allowed children access to the film with such potent content for a horror film they were entirely unprepared for. \"I don't think the younger kids really knew what hit them,\" he said. \"They were used to going to movies, sure, and they'd seen some horror movies before, sure, but this was something else.\" According to Ebert, the film affected the audience immediately:< name=\"Ebertreview\"/>\n\n\nResponse from Variety Film Reviews after the initial release lects the outrage generated by Romero's film: \"Until the Supreme Court establishes clear-cut guidelines for the pornography of violence, Night of the Living Dead will serve nicely as an outer-limit definition by example. In [a] mere 90 minutes this horror film (pun intended) casts serious aspersions on the integrity and social responsibility of its Pittsburgh-based makers, distributor Walter Reade, the film industry as a whole and [exhibitors] who book [the picture], as well as raising doubts about the future of the regional cinema movement and about the moral health of film goers who cheerfully opt for this unrelieved orgy of sadism...\"<></>\n\nOne commentator asserts that the film garnered little attention from critics, \"except to provoke argument about censorship its grisly scenes\".</> and it is regarded by many as one of the best films of 1968.<></><></><></> In 2008, the film was ranked by Empire (film magazine) magazine No. 397 of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.<></> The New York Times also placed the film on their Best 1000 Movies Ever list.<></> In January 2010, Total Film included the film on its list of The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time.<></> Rolling Stone magazine named Night of the Living Dead one of The 100 Maverick Movies in the Last 100 Years.<></>\nNight of the Living Dead was also awarded two distinguished honors decades after its debut. The Library of Congress added the film to the National Film Registry in 1999 with other films deemed \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".</> The Chicago Film Critics Association named it the 5th scariest film ever made.<></> The film also ranked No. 9 on Bravo (U.S. TV channel)'s </>\nCritical response\n\nReviewers disliked the film's gory special effects. Variety (magazine) labeled Night of the Living Dead an \"unrelieved orgy of Sadomasochism\" and questioned the \"integrity and social responsibility of its Pittsburgh-based makers\". Romero confessed that the film was designed to lect the tensions of the time: \"It was 1968, man. Everybody had a 'message'. The anger and attitude and all that's there is just because it was the Sixties. We lived at the farmhouse, so we were always into raps about the implication and the meaning, so some of that crept in\".< name=\"RomeroJones\"/>\n\nOther commentators, most notably Chris Iacovelli, assert that this is a film classic and should be praised for its ground-breaking and thought-provoking approach to bringing the discussion of man\u2019s disregard and aversion to others outside their class/caste/ethnicity from the halls of academia and into the homes of mainstream America.\nInfluence\n\nFile:Girl zombie eating her victim Night of the Living Dead bw.jpg\nRomero revolutionized the horror film genre with Night of the Living Dead; according to Almar Haflidason of the BBC, the film represented \"a new dawn in horror film-making\".</> Another colorized version appeared in 1997 from Anchor Bay Entertainment with grey-skinned zombies.</> In 2009, Legend Films coproduced a colorized 3D film version of the film with PassmoreLab, a company that converts 2-D film into 3-D format.<></> The film was theatrically released on October 14, 2010.<></> According to Legend Films founder Barry Sandrew, Night of the Living Dead is the first entirely live action 2-D film to be converted to 3-D.<></><></>\n\nIn 1999, co-writer John A.

Nelson of Mystery Science Theater 3000 fame released a single-person \"riff\" on the movie, providing humorous commentary through the course of the movie. Later a revision was made featuring Nelson along with Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy (actor) who had previously worked with Nelson on Mystery Science Theater 3000. The movie is available as downloadable video file or as a DVD through the group's website RiffTrax which is under the influence of Legend Films.<></>\nFilm series\n\nRomero's Dead films\n\nNight of the Living Dead is the first of six ...of the Dead films directed by George Romero. Following the 1968 film, Romero released Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead (1985 film), Land of the Dead, Diary of the Dead and Survival of the Dead. Each film traces the evolution of the living dead epidemic in the United States and humanity's desperate attempts to cope with it. As in Night of the Living Dead, Romero peppered the other films in the series with critiques specific to the periods in which they were released.\nReturn of the Living Dead series\n\n\nThe same year Day of the Dead premiered, Night of the Living Dead co-writer John Russo released a film titled The Return of the Living Dead that offers an alternate continuity (fiction) to the original film than Dawn of the Dead, but acted more as a parody or satire and is not considered a sequel to the original 1968 film. Russo's film spawned four Return of the Living Dead (film series). Return of the Living Dead sparked a legal battle with Romero, who believed Russo marketed his film in direct competition with Day of the Dead as a sequel to the original film. In the case Dawn Associates v. Links, Romero accused Russo of \"appropriat[ing] part of the title of the prior work\", plagiarism Dawn of the Dead's advertising slogan (\"When there is no more room in hell [...] the dead will walk the earth\"), and copying stills from the original 1968 film. Romero was ultimately granted a restraining order that forced Russo to cease his advertising campaign. Russo, however, was allowed to retain his title.</>\n\nOn September 15, 2009, it was announced that Simon West planned a 3D retelling of the original movie, to be titled Night of the Living Dead: Origins 3D.<></><></> The movie is being written and directed by Zebediah de Soto. The cast includes Tony Todd as Ben, Danielle Harris as Barbra, Joseph Pilato as Harry Cooper, Alona Tal as Helen Cooper, Bill Moseley as Johnny, Tom Sizemore as Chief McClellan and newcomers Erin Braswell as Judy and Michael Diskint as Tom.<></><></><></><></><></><></> \nDirector Doug Schulze's 2011 film  Mimesis (a.k.a. Mimesis: Night of the Living Dead) relates the story of a group of horror film fans who become involved in a \"real-life\" version of the 1968 film.<></><></>\nCopyright status\nNight of the Living Dead entered the public domain because the original theatrical distributor, the Walter Reade Organization, neglected to place a copyright indication on the prints.

Based on the novel of the same name by A. S. Fleischman, the film is about an ex-army officer who accidentally kills a woman's son, and tries to make up for it by escorting the funeral procession through dangerous Indian territory. The Deadly Companions was Sam Peckinpah's motion picture directorial debut.\nPlot\nAfter her young son is killed in a bank robbery, Kit Tilden (Maureen O'Hara) is determined to bury him beside his father in Siringo, now deserted and located in Apache territory. Yellowleg (Brian Keith), the ex-army sergeant who accidentally killed her son, decides to help take the body across the desert to be buried, whether Kit wants help or not.\nStarring\nMaureen O'Hara as Kit Tilden\nBrian Keith as Yellowleg\nSteve Cochran as Billy Keplinger\nChill Wills as Turk\nFeaturing\nStrother Martin as Parson\nWill Wright as Doctor Acton\nJim O'Hara as Cal, General Store\nPeter O'Crotty as Mayor of Hila City\nBilly Vaughan as Mead Tildon Jr.\nBig John Hamilton as gambler (uncredited)\nProduction\nDirectorial debut\nAfter the cancellation of his 1960 television series The Westerner, Brian Keith was cast as the male lead in The Deadly Companions. He suggested Sam Peckinpah (the producer and director of The Westerner) as the director for this film, and producer Charles B. Fitzsimons accepted the idea. By most accounts, the low-budget film shot on location in Arizona was a learning process for Peckinpah. Unable to rewrite the screenplay or edit the picture, Peckinpah vowed to never again direct a film unless he had script control. The Deadly Companions passed largely without notice and is the least known of Peckinpah's films.\nCast and crew\nCharles B. Fitzsimons (1924\u20132001), a former actor, was Maureen O'Hara's younger brother. In addition to his listing as producer, the film's opening credits indicate \"song by Marlin Skiles & Charles B. Fitzsimons; sung by Maureen O'Hara\" (the title of the song, which is heard through the entire length of the opening credits, is not specified). Another younger brother, Jim O'Hara (1927\u20131992), played the seventh-billed role of Cal (the family surname is Fitzsimons, also rendered as FitzSimons).\nLeading man Brian Keith was also Maureen O'Hara's co-star in The Parent Trap which they completed immediately before The Deadly Companions and which premiered on June 12, 1961, six days after the Tucson premiere of The Deadly Companions. They re-teamed for one additional film, 1966's The Rare Breed, which top-billed James Stewart. Cinematographer William H. Clothier also worked on The Rare Breed as well as two other films with Maureen O'Hara, 1963's McLintock! and 1971's Big Jake, both starring John Wayne.",

The film is said to have influenced the Oscar-winning 1931 Western Cimarron, which also depicts the land rush. In the Cherokee Strip of Oklahoma during the 1880's and early 1890's, the government lands that were leased to cattlemen were opened to settlement by homesteaders. To allow a fair chance for everyone, the prospective homesteaders were required to register and registrants were prohibited from entering into the Strip before the appointed time. Those who tried to get there beforehand were called \"Sooners\". Hence the nickname of Oklahoma is the Sooner State. When a cannon shot signaled the start of the land rush, a hundred thousand men and women tried to stake their claims. This was William S. Hart's last film. Dec.6 1864 -- June 23 1946.",

The film was based on a best-selling novel from 1924 of the same name, written by Percy Marks, a Brown University English instructor who chronicled the life of the fast-set of that university and used the fictitious Sanford College as a backdrop. The Plastic Age is known to most silent film fans as the very first hit of Clara Bow's career, and helped jumpstart her fast rise to stardom. Frederica Sagor Maas and Eve Unsell adapted the book for the screen.\nPlot\nHugh Carver (Donald Keith) is an athletic star and a freshman at Prescott College. During a hazing initiation by his fraternity brothers, he meets Cynthia Day (Clara Bow), a popular girl who loves to party and have a good time. She introduces him to the pleasures of illicit drinking, dancing at illegal roadhouses, and getting nasty in the back seats of cars. A love-triangle develops between Day, Carver, and Carver's roommate, Carl Peters (Gilbert Roland), who also likes Day. Eventually, Peters gives up his crush on Day and reconciles his friendship with Carver.\nCarver's grades, athletic performance and moral character begin to suffer as a result of his late nights and wild partying, and on a visit home, his strict father tosses him out of the house and tells him not to come back until he's 'made good'. After almost being arrested at a roadhouse raid, Day and Carver escape in her automobile, and Day realizes that her lifestyle is bad for Carver, so the two stop seeing each other.\nCarver's school performance then improves greatly, and he leads his teammates to victory at the big football game at the end of the year. Peters tells Carver that Day still loves him, and that she has changed, becoming less wild and more mature. Day and Carver are reunited at the end.",

She does not want to marry Duncan McDougall's son, Buck, until she is convinced that Raoul is dead. Buck fabricates evidence that Raoul is dead, and Nanette reluctantly agrees to marry him. She is about to be wed when Raoul returns and spirits her away from the ceremony. Raoul and Nanette are married, but Buck goads Raoul into a fight, during which one of Buck's men, Black Marat, is accidentally killed. Raoul is accused of murder and arrested, but Nanette rescues him from jail and they flee into the woods in his canoe. Corporal O'Connor, a dedicated mountie and admirer of Nanette, is ordered after the fugitives. Three years later, Raoul, his wife and baby are living deep in the woods when they are discovered by Buck and O'Connor. O'Connor arrests Raoul, who yields without a struggle, and he and his family begin the trip back when they are trapped by a great forest fire. Buck is caught drunk in a cabin and is destroyed by the fire. Raoul has an opportunity to escape when O'Connor is trapped, but he saves the mountie's life instead. O'Connor sets him free, and says that he will report Raoul as dead. O'Connor leaves the happy family, as they plan to start life anew in the wilderness.",

Lasky, the screenplay was adapted by Beulah Marie Dix from the 1905 stage play, of the same name, written by Edwin Milton Royle.\n This first screen version of the story was the legendary DeMille's first movie assignment. It also holds the distinction of being the first feature-length movie filmed specifically in Hollywood. It was not the first to be made in the Los Angeles area, and film historians agree that shorts had previously been filmed in Hollywood, with In Old California considered the earliest. Harbor scenes were shot in San Pedro, California and the western saloon set was built beside railroad tracks in the San Fernando Valley. Footage of cattle on the open range were shot at Keen Camp near Idyllwild, California, while snow scenes were shot at Mount Palomar.\n The Squaw Man went on to become the only movie successfully filmed three times by the same director/producer, DeMille. He did a silent remake in 1918, and a talkie version in 1931.",

        "description": "Neil Hamilton (Commissioner Gordon in the Batman television series) thinks he has only six months to live.\nKeeper of the Bees is a 1935 American film directed by Christy Cabanne. The film depicts WWI veteran Jamie McFarland (played by Neil Hamilton) and his search for meaning in his last six months to live, and Molly Campbell (played by Betty Furness), a young woman looking to save her sister's child from being left alone. It also features Emma Dunn as Margaret Campbell, Molly's charming mother and Edith Fellows as Jean-Marie \"Little Scout\" (not to be confused with Scout Finch), an adventurous young girl trying to fit in with her male friends.\nPlot\nJames \"Jamie\" Lewis McFarland is a veteran of the First World War whose damaged lungs means he only has six more months to live. Inspired by a nurse at the hospital he finds himself trapped in, he insists on living his last days in grand fashion and sneaks out of the hospital with the help of this nurse. On the way, he catches a ride from a good-looking young woman who catches his fancy. After riding in her car for a bit, she leaves him by the side of the road. Unfazed and fascinated by her remarkably blue eyes, he follows her to Peaceful Bay, where he comes across the house of an old beekeeper who is in critically poor health.\nWhile Jamie seeks medical attention for the man, the Beekeeper instructs him to take care of his bees while he's away at the hospital, assuring him that his partner in beekeeping will come by soon to help. After the Beekeeper is taken away, his partner introduces himself as 10-year old \"Little Scout,\" an enthusiastic young child with much knowledge of the keeping and maintenance of bees. He teaches Jamie the ways of the ranch and introduced him to his friends, who enjoy acting as a mock military battalion. He also meets his neighbor Ms. Campbell, a charming mother figure who takes care of him and treats him as she would a son. It is revealed in a separate scene that she has been missing her daughter for several months and that her daughter is the woman Jamie had gotten a ride from earlier.\nThat night, while on a walk, Jamie runs into this woman, crying to herself. After imploring her to tell him what's wrong, she admits that she needs to become legally married to someone for some undisclosed reason. Realizing that he's falling in love with her, he agrees to marry her if only legally. Despite his best efforts, she refuses to tell him her name. The next day, they are married at the courthouse, where Jamie learns that the mystery woman's name is \"Louise\". The woman immediately leaves Jamie and he returns to his bees, disappointed.\nA series of rapid events quickly shakes his world: First, the old Beekeeper falls ill and dies, surprisingly leaving half of his possessions to Jamie and the other half to Little Scout, including the bees and their surrounding property. Little Scout admits to Jamie that she is actually a girl trying to blend in with the neighborhood boys, which leads him to encourage her to do what she wants as herself and not under a guise. Finally, Jamie receives a call telling him that his \"wife\" has just given birth and is ill.\nHe rushes to the hospital and finds a woman he's never met in the hospital bed, apologizing for never explaining to him the situation before dying. He returns to the house with a baby and a renewed confusion about the situation. Soon, the young woman to whom he is married arrives and reveals to him the whole story: that she is actually Molly Campbell (the niece of Ms. Campbell) and Louise is her cousin, the one who died in the hospital giving birth. Molly needed a marriage certificate, which she obtained by marrying Jamie as Louise, in order to save her cousin from others shaming her for having a baby outside of marriage. She wanted to keep this news from her mother to save her from the grief. Ms. Campbell hears anyway, but decides to not reveal this, instead opting to simply \"have faith.\"\nCast\nNeil Hamilton as James \"Jamie\" Lewis McFarland\nBetty Furness as Molly Campbell\nEmma Dunn as Margaret Campbell\nEdith Fellows as Jean Marie Meredith / Little Scout\nHobart Bosworth as Michael the Bee Master\nHelen Jerome Eddy as Priscilla / Shorty\nMarion Shilling as Louise\nJames P.

Their family doctor suggests that they think about artificial insemination, which at the time was considered a scandalous choice. Stars: Dorothy Duke, William Thomason, and Timothy Farrell",
